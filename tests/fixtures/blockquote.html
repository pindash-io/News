<p><code>unsafe</code> is a lot like uranium. it’s just one more metal ore you can process, refine, and machine. it doesn’t combust in atmosphere, it doesn’t corrode or make weird acids. unless you go out of your way to make it dangerous you don’t even have to worry about critical masses. you can work with it pretty normally most of the time</p>
