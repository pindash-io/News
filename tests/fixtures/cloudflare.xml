On a daily basis job-seekers will be uploading their CVs, cover letters and other supplementary documents to your servers. What if someone tried to upload malware instead?</p><p>Today we’re making your security team job easier by providing a file content scanning engine integrated with our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/">Web Application Firewall (WAF)</a>, so that malicious files being uploaded by end users get blocked before they reach application servers.</p><p>Enter WAF Content Scanning.</p><p>If you are an enterprise customer, reach out to your account team to get access.</p><h2 id="making-content-scanning-easy">Making content scanning easy</h2><p>At Cloudflare, we pride ourselves on making our products very easy to use. WAF Content Scanning was built with that goal in mind. The main requirement to use the Cloudflare WAF is that application traffic is proxying via the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network/">Cloudflare network</a>. Once that is done, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/about/content-scanning/#1-enable-waf-content-scanning">turning on Content Scanning requires a single API call</a>.</p><p>Once on, the WAF will automatically detect any content being uploaded, and when found, scan it and provide the results for you to use when writing WAF Custom Rules or reviewing security analytics dashboards.</p><p>The entire process runs inline with your HTTP traffic and requires no change to your application.</p><p>As of today, we scan files up to 1 MB. You can easily block files that exceed this size or perform other actions such as log the upload.</p><p>To block a malicious file, you could write a simple WAF Custom Rule like the following:</p><p>if: <code>(cf.waf.content_scan.has_malicious_obj)</code></p><p>then: <code>BLOCK</code></p><p>In the dashboard the rule would look like this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/01/image4.png" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare can help stop malware before it reaches your app"></figure><p>Many other use cases can be achieved by leveraging the metadata exposed by the WAF Content Scanning engine. For example, let’s say you only wanted to allow PDF files to be uploaded on a given endpoint. You would achieve this by deploying the following WAF Custom Rule:</p><p>if: <code>any(cf.waf.content_scan.obj_types[*] != "application/pdf") and http.request.uri.path eq "/upload"</code></p><p>then: <code>BLOCK</code></p><p>This rule will, for any content file being uploaded to the /upload endpoint, block the HTTP request if at least one file is not a PDF.</p><p>More generally, let’s assume your application does not expect content to be uploaded at all. In this case, you can block any upload attempts with:</p><p>if: <code>(cf.waf.content_scan.has_obj)</code></p><p>then: <code>BLOCK</code></p><p>Another very common use case is supporting file upload endpoints that accept JSON content. In this instance files are normally embedded into a JSON payload after being base64-encoded. If your application has such an endpoint, you can provide additional metadata to the scanning engine to recognise the traffic by submitting a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/about/content-scanning/#custom-scan-expressions">custom scan expression</a>. Once submitted, files within JSON payloads will be parsed, decoded, and scanned automatically. In the event you want to issue a block action, you can use a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-dashboard/#configuring-a-custom-response-for-blocked-requests">JSON custom response type</a> so that your web application front end can easily parse and display error messages:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/01/image1.png" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare can help stop malware before it reaches your app"></figure><p>The full list of fields exposed by the WAF Content Scanning engine can be found on our <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/about/content-scanning/">developer documentation</a>.</p><h2 id="the-engine">The engine</h2><h3 id="scanned-content-objects">Scanned content objects</h3><p>A lot of time designing the system was spent defining what should be scanned. Defining this properly helps us ensure that we are not scanning unnecessary content reducing latency impact and CPU usage, and that there are no bypasses making the system complementary to existing WAF functionality.</p><p>The complexity stems from the fact that there is no clear definition of a “file” in HTTP terms. That’s why in this blog post and in the system design, we refer to “content object” instead.</p><p>At a high level, although this can loosely be defined as a “file”, not all “content objects” may end up being stored in the file system of an application server! Therefore, we need a definition that applies to HTTP. Additional complexity is given by the fact this is a security product, and attackers will always try to abuse HTTP to obfuscate/hide true intentions. So for example, although a <code>Content-Type</code> header may indicate that the request body is a <code>jpeg</code> image, it may actually be a <code>pdf</code>.</p><p>With the above in mind, a “content object” as of today, is any request payload that is detected by heuristics (so no referring to the <code>Content-Type</code> header) to be anything that is <strong>not</strong> <code>text/html</code>, <code>text/x-shellscript</code>, <code>application/json</code> or <code>text/xml</code>. All other content types are considered a content object.</p><p>Detecting via heuristics the content type of an HTTP request body is not enough, as content objects might be found within portions of the HTTP body or encoded following certain rules, such as when using <code>multipart/form-data</code>, which is the most common encoding used when creating standard HTML file input forms.</p><p>So when certain payload formats are found, additional parsing applies. As of today the engine will automatically parse and perform content type heuristics on individual components of the payload, when the payload is either encoded using <code>multipart/form-data</code> or <code>multipart/mixed</code> or a <code>JSON</code> string that may have “content objects” embedded in base64 format <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/about/content-scanning/#2-optional-configure-a-custom-scan-expression">as defined by the customer</a></p><p>In these cases, we don’t scan the entire payload as a single content object, but we parse it following the relevant standard and apply scanning, if necessary, to the individual portions of the payload. That allows us to support scanning of more than one content object per request, such as an HTML form that has multiple file inputs. We plan to add additional automatic detections in the future on complex payloads moving forward.</p><p>In the event we end up finding a malicious match, but we were not able to detect the content type correctly, we will default to reporting a content type of <code>application/octet-stream</code> in the Cloudflare logs/dashboards.</p><p>Finally, it is worth noting that we explicitly avoid scanning anything that is plain text (HTML, JSON, XML etc.) as finding attack vectors in these payloads is already covered by the WAF, API Gateway and other web application security solutions already present in Cloudflare’s portfolio.</p><h3 id="local-scans">Local scans</h3><p>At Cloudflare, we try to leverage our horizontal architecture to build scalable software. This means the underlying scanner is deployed on every server that handles customer HTTP/S traffic. The diagram below describes the setup:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/01/image5.png" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare can help stop malware before it reaches your app"></figure><p>Having each server perform the scanning locally helps ensure latency impact is reduced to a minimum to applicable HTTP requests. The actual scanning engine is the same one used by the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/">Cloudflare Web Gateway</a>, our forward proxy solution that among many other things, helps keep end user devices safe by blocking attempts to download malware.</p><p>Consequently, the scanning capabilities provided match <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/filtering/http-policies/antivirus-scanning/">those exposed by the Web Gateway AV scanning</a>. The main difference as of today, is the maximum file size currently limited at 1 MB versus 15 MB in Web Gateway. We are working on increasing this to match the Web Gateway in the coming months.</p><h2 id="separating-detection-from-mitigation">Separating detection from mitigation</h2><p>A new approach that we are adopting within our application security portfolio is the separation of detection from mitigation. The WAF Content Scanning features follow this approach, as once turned on, it simply enhances all available data and fields with scan results. The benefits here are twofold.</p><p>First, this allows us to provide visibility into your application traffic, without you having to deploy any mitigation. This automatically opens up a great use case: discovery. For large enterprise applications security teams may not be aware of which paths or endpoints might be expecting file uploads from the Internet. Using our WAF Content Scanning feature in conjunction with our <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/security-analytics/">new Security Analytics</a> they can now filter on request traffic that has a file content object (a file being uploaded) to observe top N paths and hostnames, exposing such endpoints.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/01/image2.png" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare can help stop malware before it reaches your app"></figure><p>Second, as mentioned in the prior section, exposing the intelligence provided by Cloudflare as fields that can be used in our WAF Custom Rules allows us to provide a very flexible platform. As a plus, you don’t need to learn how to use a new feature, as you are likely already familiar with our WAF Custom Rule builder.</p><p>This is not a novel idea, and our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/">Bot Management</a> solution was the first to trial it with great success. Any customer who uses Bot Management today gains access to a bot score field that indicates the likelihood of a request coming from automation or a human. Customers use this field to deploy rules that block bots.</p><p>To that point, let’s assume you run a job applications site, and you do not wish for bots and crawlers to automatically submit job applications. You can now block file uploads coming from bots!</p><p>if: <code>(cf.bot_management.score lt 10 and cf.waf.content_scan.has_obj)</code></p><p>then: <code>BLOCK</code></p><p>And that’s the power we wish to provide at your fingertips.</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2><p>Our WAF Content Scanning is a new feature, and we have several improvements planned, including increasing the max content size scanned, exposing the “rewrite” action, so you can send malicious files to a quarantine server, and exposing better analytics that allow you to explore the data more easily without deploying rules. Stay tuned!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The state of HTTP in 2022]]></title><description><![CDATA[So what happened at all of those working group meetings, specification documents, and side events in 2022?

One answer is that it hits a “sweet spot” for most applications that need an application protocol. “<a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9205.html">Building Protocols with HTTP</a>” (published in 2022 as a Best Current Practice RFC by the <a href="https://httpwg.org/">HTTP Working Group</a>) argues that HTTP’s success can be attributed to factors like:</p><p>- familiarity by implementers, specifiers, administrators, developers, and users;<br>- availability of a variety of client, server, and proxy implementations;<br>- ease of use;<br>- availability of web browsers;<br>- reuse of existing mechanisms like authentication and encryption;<br>- presence of HTTP servers and clients in target deployments; and<br>- its ability to traverse firewalls.</p><p>Another important factor is the community of people using, implementing, and standardising HTTP. We work together to maintain and develop the protocol actively, to assure that it’s interoperable and meets today’s needs. If HTTP stagnates, another protocol will (justifiably) replace it, and we’ll lose all the community’s investment, shared understanding and interoperability.</p><p>Cloudflare and many others do this by sending engineers to <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-and-the-ietf/">participate in the IETF</a>, where most Internet protocols are discussed and standardised. We also attend and sponsor community events like the <a href="https://httpwork.shop">HTTP Workshop</a> to have conversations about what problems people have, what they need, and understand what changes might help them.</p><p>So what happened at all of those working group meetings, specification documents, and side events in 2022? What are implementers and deployers of the web’s protocol doing? And what’s coming next?</p><h3 id="new-specification-http-3">New Specification: HTTP/3</h3><p>Specification-wise, the biggest thing to happen in 2022 was the publication of HTTP/3, because it was an enormous step towards keeping up with the requirements of modern applications and sites by using the network more efficiently to unblock web performance.</p><p>Way back in the 90s, HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0 used a new TCP connection for each request—an astoundingly inefficient use of the network. HTTP/1.1 introduced persistent connections (which were backported to HTTP/1.0 with the `Connection: Keep-Alive` header). This was an improvement that helped servers and the network cope with the explosive popularity of the web, but even back then, the community knew it had significant limitations—in particular, head-of-line blocking (where one outstanding request on a connection blocks others from completing).</p><p>That didn’t matter so much in the 90s and early 2000s, but today’s web pages and applications place demands on the network that make these limitations performance-critical. Pages often have hundreds of assets that all compete for network resources, and HTTP/1.1 wasn’t up to the task. After some <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP-NG/">false starts</a>, the community finally <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/http-2-for-web-developers/">addressed these issues with HTTP/2 in 2015</a>.</p><p>However, removing head-of-line blocking in HTTP exposed the same problem one layer lower, in TCP. Because TCP is an in-order, reliable delivery protocol, loss of a single packet in a flow can block access to those after it—even if they’re sitting in the operating system’s buffers. This turns out to be a real issue for HTTP/2 deployment, especially on less-than-optimal networks.</p><p>The answer, of course, was to replace TCP—the venerable transport protocol that so much of the Internet is built upon. After much discussion and many drafts in the <a href="https://quicwg.org/">QUIC Working Group</a>, <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/quic-version-1-is-live-on-cloudflare/">QUIC version 1 was published as that replacement</a> in 2021.</p><p>HTTP/3 is the version of HTTP that uses QUIC. While the working group effectively finished it in 2021 along with QUIC, its publication was held until 2022 to synchronise with the publication of other documents (see below). 2022 was also a <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-view-http3-usage/">milestone year for HTTP/3 deployment</a>; Cloudflare saw <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage?range=28d">increasing adoption and confidence</a> in the new protocol.</p><p>While there was only a brief gap of a few years between HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, there isn’t much appetite for working on HTTP/4 in the community soon. QUIC and HTTP/3 are both new, and the world is still learning how best to implement the protocols, operate them, and build sites and applications using them. While we can’t rule out a limitation that will force a new version in the future, the IETF built these protocols based upon broad industry experience with modern networks, and have significant extensibility available to ease any necessary changes.</p><h3 id="new-specifications-http-core-">New specifications: HTTP “core”</h3><p>The other headline event for HTTP specs in 2022 was the publication of its “core” documents -- the heart of HTTP’s specification. The core comprises: <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html">HTTP Semantics</a> - things like methods, headers, status codes, and the message format; <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9111.html">HTTP Caching</a> - how HTTP caches work; <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9112.html">HTTP/1.1</a> - mapping semantics to the wire, using the format everyone knows and loves.</p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9113.html">HTTP/2 was republished</a> to properly integrate with the Semantics document, and to fix a few outstanding issues.</p><p>This is the latest in a long series of revisions for these documents—in the past, we’ve had the RFC 723x series, the (perhaps most well-known) RFC 2616, RFC 2068, and the grandparent of them all, RFC 1945. Each revision has aimed to improve readability, fix errors, explain concepts better, and clarify protocol operation. Poorly specified (or implemented) features are deprecated; new features that improve protocol operation are added. See the ‘Changes from...’ appendix in each document for the details. And, importantly, always refer to the latest revisions linked above; the older RFCs are now obsolete.</p><h3 id="deploying-early-hints">Deploying Early Hints</h3><p>HTTP/2 included <em>server push</em>, a feature designed to allow servers to “push” a request/response pair to clients when they knew the client was going to need something, so it could avoid the latency penalty of making a request and waiting for the response.</p><p>After HTTP/2 was finalised in 2015, Cloudflare and many other HTTP implementations soon <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-support-for-http-2-server-push-2/">rolled out server push</a> in anticipation of big performance wins. Unfortunately, it turned out that’s harder than it looks; server push effectively requires the server to predict the future—not only what requests the client will send but also what the network conditions will be. And, when the server gets it wrong (“over-pushing”), the pushed requests directly compete with the real requests that the browser is making, representing a significant opportunity cost with real potential for harming performance, rather than helping it. The impact is even worse when the browser already has a copy in cache, so it doesn’t need the push at all.</p><p>As a result, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/removing-push/">Chrome removed HTTP/2 server push in 2022</a>. Other browsers and servers might still support it, but the community seems to agree that it’s only suitable for specialised uses currently, like the browser notification-specific <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8030.html">Web Push Protocol</a>.</p><p>That doesn’t mean that we’re giving up, however. The <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc8297.html">103 (Early Hints)</a> status code was published as an Experimental RFC by the HTTP Working Group in 2017. It allows a server to send <em>hints</em> to the browser in a non-final response, before the “real” final response. That’s useful if you know that the content is going to include some links to resources that the browser will fetch, but need more time to get the response to the client (because it will take more time to generate, or because the server needs to fetch it from somewhere else, like a CDN does).</p><p>Early Hints can be used in many situations that server push was designed for -- for example, when you have CSS and JavaScript that a page is going to need to load. In theory, they’re not as optimal as server push, because they only allow hints to be sent when there’s an outstanding request, and because getting the hints to the client and acted upon adds some latency.</p><p>In practice, however, Cloudflare and our partners (like Shopify and Google) spent 2022 experimenting with Early Hints and finding them much safer to use, with <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/early-hints-performance/">promising performance benefits</a> that include significant reductions in key web performance metrics.</p><p>We’re excited about the potential that Early Hints show; so excited that we’ve <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/early-hints-on-cloudflare-pages/">integrated them into Cloudflare Pages</a>. We’re also evaluating new ways to improve performance using this new capability in the protocol.</p><h3 id="privacy-focused-intermediation">Privacy-focused intermediation</h3><p>For many, the most exciting HTTP protocol extensions in 2022 focused on intermediation—the ability to insert proxies, gateways, and similar components into the protocol to achieve specific goals, often focused on improving privacy.</p><p>The <a href="https://ietf-wg-masque.github.io">MASQUE Working Group</a>, for example, is an effort to add new tunneling capabilities to HTTP, so that an intermediary can pass the tunneled traffic along to another server.</p><p>While CONNECT has enabled TCP tunnels for a long time, MASQUE enabled <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9298">UDP tunnels</a>, allowing more protocols to be tunneled more efficiently–including QUIC and HTTP/3.</p><p>At Cloudflare, we’re enthusiastic to be working with Apple to use MASQUE to implement <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/icloud-private-relay/">iCloud Private Relay</a> and enhance their customers’ privacy without relying solely on one company. We’re also very interested in the Working Group’s future work, including <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/unlocking-quic-proxying-potential/">IP tunneling</a> that will enable MASQUE-based VPNs.<br>Another intermediation-focused specification is <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-ohai-ohttp-06.html">Oblivious HTTP</a> (or OHTTP). OHTTP uses sets of intermediaries to prevent the server from using connections or IP addresses to track clients, giving greater privacy assurances for things like collecting telemetry or other sensitive data. This specification is just finishing the standards process, and we’re using it to build an important new product, <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/building-privacy-into-internet-standards-and-how-to-make-your-app-more-private-today/">Privacy Gateway</a>, to protect the privacy of our customers’ customers.</p><p>We and many others in the Internet community believe that this is just the start, because intermediation can partition communication, a <a href="https://intarchboard.github.io/draft-obliviousness/draft-kpw-iab-privacy-partitioning.html">valuable tool for improving privacy</a>.</p><h3 id="protocol-security">Protocol security</h3><p>Finally, 2022 saw a lot of work on security-related aspects of HTTP. The <a href="https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-digest-headers.html">Digest Fields</a> specification is an update to the now-ancient `Digest` header field, allowing integrity digests to be added to messages. The <a href="https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures.html">HTTP Message Signatures</a> specification enables cryptographic signatures on requests and responses -- something that has widespread ad hoc deployment, but until now has lacked a standard. Both specifications are in the final stages of standardisation.</p><p>A <a href="https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis.html">revision of the Cookie specification</a> also saw a lot of progress in 2022, and should be final soon. Since it’s not possible to get rid of them completely soon, much work has taken place to limit how they operate to improve privacy and security, including a new `SameSite` attribute.</p><p>Another set of security-related specifications that Cloudflare has <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-supports-privacy-pass/">invested in for many years</a> is <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-privacypass-architecture-09.html">Privacy Pass</a> also known as “Private Access Tokens.” These are cryptographic tokens that can assure clients are real people, not bots, without using an intrusive CAPTCHA, and without tracking the user’s activity online. In HTTP, they take the form of a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-privacypass-auth-scheme-07.html">new authentication scheme</a>.</p><p>While Privacy Pass is still not quite through the standards process, 2022 saw its <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/">broad deployment by Apple</a>, a huge step forward. And since <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/turnstile-private-captcha-alternative/">Cloudflare uses it in Turnstile</a>, our CAPTCHA alternative, your users can have a better experience today.</p><h3 id="what-about-2023">What about 2023?</h3><p>So, what’s next? Besides, the specifications above that aren’t quite finished, the HTTP Working Group has a few other works in progress, including a <a href="https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body.html">QUERY method</a> (think GET but with a body), <a href="https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-resumable-upload.html">Resumable Uploads</a> (based on <a href="https://tus.io">tus</a>), <a href="https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-variants.html">Variants</a> (an improved Vary header for caching), <a href="https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-sfbis.html">improvements to Structured Fields</a> (including a new Date type), and a way to <a href="https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-retrofit.html">retrofit existing headers into Structured Fields</a>. We’ll write more about these as they progress in 2023.</p><p>At the <a href="https://github.com/HTTPWorkshop/workshop2022/blob/main/report.md">2022 HTTP Workshop</a>, the community also talked about what new work we can take on to improve the protocol. Some ideas discussed included improving our shared protocol testing infrastructure (right now we have a <a href="https://github.com/httpwg/wiki/wiki/HTTP-Testing-Resources">few resources</a>, but it could be much better), improving (or replacing) <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7838.html">Alternative Services</a> to allow more intelligent and correct connection management, and more radical changes, like <a href="https://mnot.github.io/I-D/draft-nottingham-binary-structured-headers.html">alternative, binary serialisations of headers</a>.</p><p>There’s also a continuing discussion in the community about whether HTTP should accommodate pub/sub, or whether it should be standardised to work over WebSockets (and soon, WebTransport). Although it’s hard to say now, adjacent work on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/moq/about/">Media over QUIC</a> that just started <em>might</em> provide an opportunity to push this forward.</p><p>Of course, that’s not everything, and what happens to HTTP in 2023 (and beyond) remains to be seen. HTTP is still evolving, even as it stays compatible with the largest distributed hypertext system ever conceived—the World Wide Web.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review]]></title><description><![CDATA[We’re excited to present the Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year In Review, featuring interactive charts, graphs, and maps you can use to explore what changed on the Internet throughout this past year]]></description><link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2022-year-in-review/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">63a2e2a15a028f000abbe0ad</guid><category><![CDATA[Cloudflare Radar]]></category><category><![CDATA[Year in Review]]></category><category><![CDATA[Internet Traffic]]></category><category><![CDATA[Trends]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[David Belson]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image21.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image21.png" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"><p><em><small>This post is also available in <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/zh-cn/radar-2022-year-in-review-zh-cn/">简体中文</a>, <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/zh-tw/radar-2022-year-in-review-zh-tw/">繁體中文</a>, <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/ko-kr/radar-2022-year-in-review-ko-kr/">한국어</a>.</small></em></p>

To that end, we’re excited to present the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022">Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year In Review</a>, featuring interactive charts, graphs, and maps you can use to explore notable Internet trends observed throughout this past year. The Year In Review website is part of <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Radar</a>, which celebrated its second birthday in September with the launch of <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/radar2/">Radar 2.0</a>.</p><p>We have organized the trends we observed around three different topic areas: <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#traffic">Traffic</a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#adoption">Adoption</a>, and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#security">Security</a>. The content covered within each of these areas is described in more detail in their respective sections below. Building on the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review-2021/">2021 Year In Review</a>, we have incorporated several additional metrics this year, and have also improved the underlying methodology. (As such, the charts are not directly comparable to develop insights into year-over-year changes.)</p><p>Website visualizations shown at a weekly granularity cover the period from January 2 through November 26, 2022 (the start of the first full week of the year through the end of the last full week of November). We plan to update the underlying data sets through the end of the year in early 2023. Trends for nearly 200 locations are available on the website, with some smaller or less populated locations excluded due to insufficient data.</p><p>Before we jump in, we urge anyone who prefers to see the headline stats up front and to explore the data themselves to go ahead and visit <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022">the website</a>. Anyone who wants a more lengthy, but curated set of observations should continue reading below. Regardless, we encourage you to consider how the trends presented within this post and the website’s various sections impact your business or organization, and to think about how these insights can inform actions that you can take to improve user experience or enhance your security posture.</p><h2 id="traffic">Traffic</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image1-56.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>Anyone following recent technology headlines might assume that the Internet's decades-long trend of incredible growth would have finally begun to falter. In times like these, data is key. Our data indicates that global Internet traffic, which grew at 23% this year, is as robust as ever.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><a id="trafficgrowth"></a>To determine the traffic trends over time, we first established a baseline, calculated as the average daily traffic volume (excluding bot traffic) over the second full calendar week (January 9-15) of 2022. We chose the second calendar week to allow time for people to get back into their “normal” routines (school, work, etc.) after the winter holidays and New Year’s Day. The percent change shown on the trend lines in our charts are calculated relative to the baseline value, and represents a seven-day trailing average — it does not represent absolute traffic volume for a location. The seven-day averaging is done to smooth the sharp changes seen with a daily granularity.
<p></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In addition to calculating traffic growth, our <a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns/">1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver</a> and broad global customer base enables us to have a unique view into online activity. This includes insights into the most popular types of Internet content and the most popular Internet services in general and across specific categories, as well as the impact of bots. Of course, none of this matters if connectivity is unavailable, so we also drill down into major Internet disruptions observed in 2022.</p><h3 id="traffic-trends">Traffic trends</h3><p>After an initial dip, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#traffic-growth">worldwide Internet traffic</a> saw nominal growth coinciding with the 2022 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing, but slipped again in the weeks after their conclusion. After a couple of months of slight growth, traffic again dipped below baseline heading into July. However, after reaching that nadir, Internet traffic experienced a fairly consistent rate of growth through the back part of the year. An upwards inflection at the end of November is visible in the worldwide traffic graph as well as the traffic graphs of a number of locations. Traffic analysis showed that this increase resulted from the convergence of early holiday shopping traffic (to e-commerce sites) with the run-up to and early days of FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/1-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>The <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/ukraine-update/"><em>An Update on Cloudflare’s assistance to Ukraine</em></a> blog post published during Impact Week looked at the conflict from an attack perspective. Viewing <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/ua#traffic-growth">Ukraine</a> through an Internet traffic lens provides unique insights into the impacts of the war’s damage and destruction to Internet connectivity within the country. After starting the year with some nominal traffic growth, that trend was quickly reversed once the Russian invasion began on February 24, with traffic quickly falling as infrastructure was damaged and the populace focused on finding safety and shelter. Although traffic started to grow again after that initial steep decline, drops in <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/tracking-shifts-in-internet-connectivity-in-kherson-ukraine/">May</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1533791750631858178">June</a> appear to be correlated with significant outages observed by Cloudflare. After returning to growth during August, several additional disruptions were visible in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Ukraine%20(from%3Acloudflareradar)%20until%3A2022-09-30%20since%3A2022-09-01&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">September</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Ukraine%20(from%3Acloudflareradar)%20until%3A2022-10-31%20since%3A2022-10-01&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">October</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Ukraine%20(from%3Acloudflareradar)%20until%3A2022-11-30%20since%3A2022-11-01&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">November</a> coincident with widespread power outages across the country resulting from Russian attacks.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/2-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>Reliable electric power is critical for reliable Internet connectivity, both for the core network infrastructure in data centers, as well as for last-mile infrastructure like cell towers and Wi-Fi routers, as well as laptops, cellphones, and other devices used to access the Internet. For several years, the residents of <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/pr#traffic-growth">Puerto Rico</a> have struggled to contend with an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/22/puerto-ricos-power-grid-is-still-costly-and-unreliable-after-hurricane-maria.html">unreliable electric grid</a>, resulting in frequent power outages and slow restoration times. In 2022, the island suffered two multi-day power outages that clearly impacted otherwise strong traffic growth. In <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1512001981820321795">April</a>, a fire at a power plant caused an outage that lasted three days, disrupting Internet connectivity during that period. In <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1571648402206883840">September</a>, widespread power outages resulting from damage from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/23/1124345084/impact-hurricane-fiona-puerto-rico">Hurricane Fiona</a> resulted in a rapid drop in Internet traffic with the disruption lasting over a week until power restoration work and infrastructure repair was completed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/3-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3><a id="topcategories"></a>Top categories</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Cloudflare’s global customer base spans a range of industry categories, including technology, e-commerce, and entertainment, among others. Analysis of the traffic to our customers’ websites and applications reveals which categories of content were most popular throughout the year, and can be broken out by user location. The domains associated with each customer zone have one or more associated categories — these can be <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains/feedback">viewed on Cloudflare Radar</a>. To calculate the distribution of traffic across the set of categories for each location, we divided the number of requests for domains associated with a given category seen over the course of a week by the total number of requests mapped to a category seen over that week, filtering out bot traffic. If a domain is associated with multiple categories, then the associated request was included in the aggregate count for each category. The chart shows how the distribution of requests across the selected categories changes over the course of the year.</p><p><a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#traffic-category-popularity">Globally</a>, sites in the Technology category were the most popular, accounting for approximately one-third of traffic throughout the year. The next most popular category was Business &amp; Economy, which drove approximately 15% of traffic. Shopping &amp; Auctions also saw a bump in traffic in November, as consumers began their holiday shopping.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/4-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>In sharp contrast to other Asian countries, in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/kr#traffic-category-popularity">South Korea</a>, Internet Communication was consistently the second most popular category during the year. Elsewhere, Internet Communication was occasionally among the top five, but usually within the top 10. Internet Communication was followed closely by Entertainment and Business &amp; Economy. The former saw multiple periods of increased traffic through the year, in contrast to other categories, which saw traffic share remain fairly consistent over time.</p><p>Traffic distribution in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/tr#traffic-category-popularity">Turkey</a> represented a rare departure from most other locations around the world. Although Technology started the year as the most popular category, its popularity waned during the back half of the year, ending below Shopping &amp; Auctions and Society &amp; Lifestyle. These latter two saw gradual growth starting in September, and posted larger increases in November. Business &amp; Economy and Entertainment sites were comparatively less popular here, in contrast to many other locations.</p><p><a href="https://yir.radar-frontend.pages.dev/year-in-review/2022/am#traffic-category-popularity">Armenia’s</a> traffic distribution also ran counter to that seen in most other locations. Entertainment was the most popular category for nearly the entire year, except for the final week of November. Technology was generally the second most popular category, although it was surpassed by Gambling several times throughout the year. However, Gambling saw its popularity fall significantly in November, as it was surpassed by the Shopping &amp; Auctions and Business &amp; Economy categories.</p><h3 id="most-popular-internet-services">Most popular Internet services</h3><p>The luxury of being a popular Internet service is that the service’s brand becomes very recognizable, so it will be no surprise that Google was #1 in our General ranking.</p><p><strong>Top 10 — General, late 2022 ranking</strong><br>1.

Amazon<br>10. iCloud, Netflix, Twitter, Yahoo (tie)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><a id="internetservices"></a>Last year TikTok was at the top of our ranking. However, the results between the two years aren’t comparable. As part of our launch of <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/radar2/">Radar 2.0</a>, we introduced improvements to our <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-domain-rankings/">domain ranking algorithms</a>, and this year’s rankings are based on those new algorithms. In addition, this year we have grouped domains that all belong to a single Internet service. For example, Google operates google.com, google.pt, and mail.google.com among others, so we aggregated the popularity of each domain under a single “Google” Internet service for simplicity. However, while Meta operates both Facebook and Instagram, consumers typically perceive those brands as distinct, so we decided to group domains associated with those services separately.
<p></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Zooming out from our General top 10, the anonymized DNS query data from our <a href="http://1.1.1.1">1.1.1.1</a> public DNS resolver reflects traffic from millions of users around the world, enabling us to offer category specific rankings as well. While you can view them all in the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#most-popular-domains">“Most popular Internet services” section</a> of our Year in Review website, we’ve decided to highlight a few of our favorite observations below.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies always seem to have as much promise as they have controversy. We couldn’t help but be curious about which cryptocurrency services were the most popular. But before jumping into the Top 10, let’s double-click on one that fell out of the running: FTX. Known as the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ftx-crypto-bankruptcy-filing-ed0f06c5db468e285f58af2d8766b51a">third largest</a> cryptocurrency exchange in the world, our popularity ranking shows it hovered around 9th place for most of the year. That is, until it <a href="https://pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/33/188450/042020648197.pdf">filed</a> for bankruptcy in November. At that point, there is a precipitous drop, which also appears to coincide with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftx-suspends-onboarding-new-clients-2022-11-10/">reports</a> that FTX disabled its users’ ability to make cryptocurrency withdrawals. Moving back to the Top 10, the two other major cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, ranked #1 and #3 respectively and don’t appear to have been adversely impacted by FTX in our rankings.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/5-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>The universe has been the hottest place to be since the beginning of time, but <a href="https://twitter.com/lexfridman/status/1497632164829188101">some suggest</a> that we’ll all soon be in the metaverse. If that’s true, then the question becomes “Whose metaverse?”. Last year, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">Facebook changed its name to Meta</a> as it poured billions of dollars into the space, so we were curious about the impact of their efforts on the metaverse landscape one year later. With Meta’s Oculus offering their initial foray into the metaverse, our data indicates that while its popularity saw tangible improvements, rising from 10th to 5th in the back half of the year, Roblox is clearly the champion of the metaverse arena. It is fascinating to see this smaller challenger dominating Oculus, which is operated by Meta, a company <a href="https://8marketcap.com/compare/roblox/meta-platforms/">~18x</a> larger in market capitalization. We are excited to check back at the end of 2023 to see whether Oculus’ ascent of the rankings topples Roblox, or if the smaller player retains the crown.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/6-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>Facebook’s transition to Meta, however, does not appear to have impacted its popularity as a social media platform. Within our ranking of the top social media platforms, Facebook held the top position throughout the year. TikTok and Snapchat also held steady in their places among the top five. Instagram and Twitter traded places several times mid-year, but the photo and video sharing app ultimately knocked Twitter from 3rd place in August. More active volatility was seen in the bottom half of the top 10, as LinkedIn, Discord, and Reddit frequently shifted between sixth, seventh, and eighth position in the rankings.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/7-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>While those are the most popular sites today, over the last 20+ years, the landscape of social media platforms has been quite dynamic, with new players regularly emerging. Some gained a foothold and became successful, while others became a footnote of Internet history. Although it has actually been around since 2016, Mastodon emerged as the latest potential disruptor in the space. In a landscape where the top social media platforms operate closed-source, centralized platforms, Mastodon offers free, open source software to allow anyone to start their own social networking platform, built around a decentralized architecture, and easily federated with others.</p><p>Aggregating the domain names used by 400 top Mastodon instances, this cohort started the year hovering around the #200 rank of most popular services overall. Its position in the overall rankings steadily improved throughout the year, hitting an inflection point in November, moving up about 60 positions. This trend appears to be driven by a spike in interest and usage of Mastodon, which we elaborate on in the Adoption section below.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/8-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3><a id="bottraffic"></a>Bot traffic</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Bot traffic describes any non-human traffic to a website or an app. Some bots are useful, such as those that monitor site and application availability or search engine bots that index content for search, and Cloudflare maintains a list of <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/glossary/#verified-bots">verified bots</a> known to perform such services. However, visibility into other non-verified bot activity is just as, if not more, important as they may be used to perform malicious activities, such as breaking into user accounts or scanning the web for exposed vulnerabilities to exploit. To calculate bot traffic percentages, we used the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/">bot score</a> assigned to each request to identify those made by bots, and then divided the total number of daily requests from these bots by the total number of daily requests. These calculations were done both globally and on a per-location basis. The line shown in the trends graph represents a seven-day trailing average. For the top 10 chart, we calculated the average bot percentage on a monthly basis per location, and then ranked the locations by percentage. The chart illustrates the ranking by month, and how those rankings change across the year.</p><p><a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#bot-traffic">Globally</a>, bots generally accounted for between 30-35% of traffic over the course of the year. Starting January at around 35%, the percentage of bot traffic dropped by nearly a quarter through the end of February, but then reclaimed some of that loss, staying just above 30% through October. A slight downward trend is evident at the start of November, due to human traffic increasing while bot traffic remained fairly consistent. Despite a couple of nominal spikes/drops, the global trend exhibited fairly low volatility overall throughout the year.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/9-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>While around one-third of global traffic was from bots, two locations stood out with bot traffic percentages double the global level. Except for two brief mid-year spikes, just under 70% of traffic from <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/ie#bot-traffic">Ireland</a> was classified as bot-driven. Similarly, in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/sg#bot-traffic">Singapore</a>, bot traffic consistently ranged between 60-70% across the year. Bots account for the majority share of traffic from these locations due to the presence of <a href="https://www.cloudinfrastructuremap.com/#/service/cloud-regions">local “regions”</a> from multiple cloud platform providers in each. Because doing so is easily automated and free/inexpensive, attackers will frequently spin up ephemeral instances in these clouds in order to launch high volume attacks, such as we saw with the <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/26m-rps-ddos/">“Mantis”</a> attack in June. (Internal traffic analysis indicates that a significant portion of traffic for these two geographies is from cloud provider networks and that the vast majority of traffic we see from these networks is classified as bot traffic.)</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/10-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/11-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>The <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#bot-traffic">top 10 list</a> of locations with the highest percentage of bot traffic saw a fair amount of movement throughout the year, with four different locations holding the top slot at some point during the year, although Turkmenistan spent the most time at the top of the list. Overall, 17 locations held a spot among the top 10 at some point during 2022, with greater concentrations in Europe and Asia.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3><a id="outages"></a>Internet outages</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Although the metrics included in the 2022 Year In Review were ultimately driven by Internet traffic to Cloudflare from networks and locations around the world, there are, unfortunately, times when traffic is disrupted. These disruptions can have a number of potential causes, including natural disasters and extreme weather, fiber optic cable cuts, or power outages. However, they can also happen when authoritarian governments order Internet connectivity to be shutdown at a network, regional, or national level.</p><p>We saw examples of all of these types of Internet disruptions, and more, during 2022, and aggregated coverage of them in <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/searchresults/#q=%22internet%20disruptions%20overview%22&amp;sort=relevancy&amp;f:@customer_facing_source=[Blog]">quarterly overview blog posts</a>. With the launch of <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/">Radar 2.0</a> in September, we also began to catalog them on the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center">Cloudflare Radar Outage Center</a>. These disruptions are most often visible as drops in Cloudflare traffic from a given network, region, or country. The 2022 Year In Review website illustrates <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#internet-outages">where these disruptions occurred</a> throughout the year. Some notable outages observed during 2022 are highlighted below.</p><p>One of the most significant Internet disruptions of the year took place on <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as812">AS812 (Rogers)</a>, one of Canada’s largest Internet service providers. During the morning of July 8, a near complete loss of traffic was observed, and it took nearly 24 hours for traffic volumes to return to normal levels. A Cloudflare <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-view-of-the-rogers-communications-outage-in-canada/">blog post</a> covered the Rogers outage in real-time as the provider attempted to restore connectivity. Data from APNIC <a href="https://stats.labs.apnic.net/cgi-bin/aspop?c=CA">estimates</a> that as many as five million users were directly affected, while <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/08/rogers-network-outage-across-canada-hit-banks-businesses-and-consumers.html">press coverage</a> noted that the outage also impacted phone systems, retail point of sale systems, automatic teller machines, and online banking services. According to a <a href="https://about.rogers.com/news-ideas/a-message-from-rogers-president-and-ceo/">notice</a> posted by the Rogers CEO, the outage was attributed to “a network system failure following a maintenance update in our core network, which caused some of our routers to malfunction”.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/12.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>In late September, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/middleeast/iran-mahsa-amini-death-widespread-protests-intl-hnk/index.html">protests and demonstrations erupted across Iran</a> in response to the death of Mahsa Amini.

The line shown in the trends graph represents a seven-day trailing average.

<p></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In looking at the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#mobile-device-usage">top 10 chart</a>, we note that Iran and Sudan held the top two slots for much of the year, bookended by Yemen in January and Mauritania in November. Below the top two spots, however, significant volatility is clear throughout the year within the rest of the top 10. However, this movement was actually concentrated across a relatively small percentage range, with just five to ten percentage points separating the top and bottom ranked locations, depending on the week. The top ranked locations generally saw 80-85% of traffic from mobile devices, while the bottom ranked locations saw 75-80% of traffic from mobile devices.</p><p>This analysis reinforces the importance of mobile connectivity in Iran, and underscores why mobile network providers were targeted for Internet shutdowns in September and October, as discussed above.

One way we do that is by protecting customer websites, applications, and network infrastructure from malicious traffic and attacks. Because malicious actors regularly use a variety of techniques and approaches in launching their attacks, we have a number of products within our security solution portfolio that provide customers with flexibility around how they handle these attacks. Below, we explore insights derived from the attack mitigation we do on behalf of customers, including how we are mitigating attacks, what kinds of websites and applications attacks are targeting, and where these attacks appear to be coming from. In addition, with the <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-are-acquiring-area-1/">acquisition of Area 1</a> earlier in 2022, we are presenting insight into where malicious email originates from. Analysis of this data highlights that there is very much no “one size fits all” security solution, as attackers use a wide variety of techniques, frequently shifting between them. As such, having a broad but flexible portfolio of security solutions at the ready is critical for CISOs and CIOs.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3><a id="mitigation"></a>Mitigation sources</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Depending on the approach taken by an attacker, and the type of content being targeted, one attack mitigation technique may be preferable over another. Cloudflare refers to these techniques as “mitigation sources”, and they include popular tools and techniques like <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/">Web Application Firewall</a> (WAF) and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ddos-mitigation/">DDoS Mitigation</a> (DDoS), but also lesser known ones like <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/recipes/block-ip-reputation/">IP Reputation</a> (IPR), <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/">Access Rules</a> (AR), <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-bot-management/">Bot Management</a> (BM), and <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-api-shield/">API Shield</a> (APIS). Examining the distribution of mitigation sources applied by location can help us better understand the types of attacks originating from those locations. To calculate the percentage of mitigated traffic associated with each mitigation source by location, we divided the total number of daily mitigated requests for each source by the total number of mitigated requests seen that day. Bot traffic is included in these calculations, given that many attacks originate from bots. A single request can be mitigated by multiple techniques, and here we consider the last technique that mitigated the request.</p><p>Across many locations, IP Reputation, Bot Management, and Access Rules accounted for small amounts of mitigated traffic throughout the year, with the volumes varying by country. However, in other locations, IP Reputation and Access Rules were responsible for larger amounts of mitigated traffic, possibly indicating those places had more of their traffic being blocked outright. A number of countries saw a rapid and significant increase in DDoS mitigated traffic during January to the 80-90% range, followed by a rapid drop to the 10-20% range. In that vein, DDoS Mitigation and WAF percentage shifts were frequently very spiky, with only occasional sustained periods of relatively consistent percentages.</p><p>Overall, DDoS Mitigation and WAF were the two most frequently used techniques to address attacks. The former’s share on a <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#approaches-to-attack-mitigation">global basis</a> was highest in mid-January, growing to nearly 80%, while the latter’s peak was during February, when it accounted for almost 60% of mitigated traffic. A spike in the usage of Access Rules is clearly visible in August, related to similar spikes observed for the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/us#approaches-to-attack-mitigation">United States</a>, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/ae#approaches-to-attack-mitigation">United Arab Emirates</a>, and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/my#approaches-to-attack-mitigation">Malaysia</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/24.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>Although Access Rules accounted for as much as 20% of mitigated traffic from the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/us#approaches-to-attack-mitigation">United States</a> in August, it saw much lower usage throughout the balance of the year. DDoS Mitigation was the primary technique used to mitigate attack traffic coming from the United States, responsible for over 80% of such traffic during the first quarter, though it steadily declined through August. In a complimentary fashion, WAF drove only ~20% of mitigated traffic early in the year, but that volume steadily grew and had tripled through August. Interestingly, the growth in Access Rules usage followed rapid growth and then similarly rapid decline in WAF, possibly suggesting that more targeted rules were implemented to augment the managed rules applied by the Web Application Firewall against US-originated attacks.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/25.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>Access Rules and IP Reputation were applied more frequently to mitigate attack traffic coming from <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/de#approaches-to-attack-mitigation">Germany</a>, with Bot Management also seeing increased usage in February, March, and June. However, except for periods in February and July, DDoS Mitigation drove the bulk of mitigated traffic, generally ranging between 60-80%. WAF mitigation was clearly most significant during February, with 70-80% of mitigated traffic, and July, at around 60%.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/26.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>In mitigating attacks coming from <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/jp#approaches-to-attack-mitigation">Japan</a>, it is interesting to see a couple of notable spikes in Bot Management. In March, it was briefly responsible for upwards of 40% of mitigated traffic, with another spike that was half as big in June. Access Rules also maintained a consistent presence in the graph, with around 5% of mitigated traffic through August, but slightly less in the following months. In dealing with Japanese attack traffic, WAF &amp; DDoS Mitigation frequently traded positions as the largest source of mitigated traffic, although there was no clear pattern or apparent cycle. Both reached as much as 90% of mitigated traffic at times throughout the year – WAF in February and DDoS Mitigation in March. DDoS Mitigation’s periods of “dominance” tended to be more sustained, lasting for several weeks, but were punctuated by brief WAF spikes.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/27.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3><a id="wafrules"></a>WAF rules</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>As noted above, Cloudflare’s WAF is frequently used to mitigate application layer attacks. There are hundreds of individually managed rules that can be applied by the WAF depending on the characteristics of the mitigated request, but these rules can be grouped into over a dozen types. Examining the distribution of WAF rules by location can help us better understand the techniques that attacks coming from that location are using. (For example, are attackers trying to inject SQL code into a form field, or exploit a published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVE</a>?) To calculate the distribution of WAF mitigated traffic across the set of rule types for each location, we divided the number of requests mitigated by a particular type of WAF rule seen over the course of a week by the total number of WAF mitigated requests seen over that week. A single request can be mitigated by multiple rules and here we consider the last rule in a sequence that mitigated the request. The chart shows how the distribution of mitigated requests across the selected rule types changes over the course of the year. Bot traffic is included in these calculations.</p><p>At a <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#waf-rule-distribution">worldwide</a> level, during the first few months of the year, approximately half of HTTP requests blocked by our Managed WAF Rules contained HTTP anomalies, such as malformed method names, null byte characters in headers, non-standard ports, or content length of zero with a POST request. During that period, <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal">Directory Traversal</a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/sql-injection/">SQL Injection (SQLi)</a> rules both accounted for just over 10% of mitigated requests as well. Attackers began to further vary their approach starting in May, as <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/cross-site-scripting/">Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</a> and <a href="http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246955/Remote%20File%20Inclusion">File Inclusion</a> both grew to over 10% of mitigations, while HTTP anomalies dropped to below 30%. Use of Software Specific rules grew above 10% in July, as attackers apparently ramped their efforts to exploit vendor-specific vulnerabilities. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/owasp-top-10/">Broken Authentication</a> and <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection">Command Injection</a> rulesets also saw some growth in activity during the last several months, suggesting that attackers increased their efforts to find vulnerabilities in login/authentication systems or to execute commands on vulnerable systems in an attempt to gain access.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/28.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>Although HTTP Anomaly was the most frequently applied rule when mitigations are aggregated at a global level, there were a number of locations where it held the top spot only briefly, if at all, as discussed below.</p><p>Attacks originating in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/au#waf-rule-distribution">Australia</a> were WAF-mitigated using a number of rulesets, with the most applied ruleset changing frequently during the first half of the year. In contrast to the global overview, HTTP Anomaly was the top ruleset for only a single week in February, when it accounted for just over 30% of mitigations. Otherwise, attacks were most frequently mitigated with Software Specific, Directory Traversal, File Inclusion, and SQLi rules, generally accounting for 25-35% of mitigations. This pattern shifted starting in July, though, as Directory Traversal attacks became the most common, staying that way through the balance of the year. After peaking in June, SQLi attacks became significantly less common, rapidly falling and staying below 10% of mitigations.</p><p>WAF mitigations of attacks originating in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/ca#waf-rule-distribution">Canada</a> also demonstrated a pattern that differed from the global one. Although the HTTP Anomaly ruleset started the year accounting for approximately two thirds of mitigated requests, it was half that by the end of January, and saw significant volatility throughout the balance of the year. SQLi mitigations of Australian traffic effectively saw an opposite pattern, starting the year below 10% of mitigations but growing rapidly, accounting for 60% or more of mitigated traffic at multiple times throughout the year. Interestingly, SQLi attacks from Canada appeared to come in multi-week waves, becoming the most applied ruleset during those waves, and then receding for a brief period.</p><p>For attacks originating in <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/ch#waf-rule-distribution">Switzerland</a>, the HTTP Anomaly ruleset was never the most frequently invoked, although it remained among the top five throughout the year. Instead, Directory Traversal and XSS rules were most frequently used, accounting for as much as 40% of mitigations. Directory Traversal most consistently held the top spot, though XSS attacks were the most prevalent during August. SQLi attacks saw peaks in April, July/August, and then again at the end of November. The Software Specific ruleset also breakout growth in September to as much as 20% of mitigated requests.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3><a id="targetcategories"></a>Target categories</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Above, we discussed how traffic distribution across a set of categories provides insights into the types of content that users are most interested in. By performing similar analysis through a mitigation lens, we can gain insights into the types of websites and applications that are being most frequently targeted by attackers. To calculate the distribution of mitigated traffic across the set of categories for each location, we divided the number of mitigated requests for domains associated with a given category seen over the course of a week by the total number of requests mapped to that category during that week. The chart shows how the distribution of mitigated requests across each category changes over the course of the year. (As such, percentages will not sum to 100%). Bot traffic is included in these calculations. The percentage of traffic that was mitigated as an attack varied widely across industries and originating locations. In some places, a nominal percentage of traffic across all categories was mitigated, while in others, multiple categories experienced spikes in mitigated traffic at multiple times during 2022.</p><p>When aggregated at a <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#content-category-attack-distribution">global</a> level, there was significant variance over the course of the year in the industry categories that attracted the most attacks as a fraction of their overall traffic. Through January and February, Technology sites had the largest percentage of mitigated requests, ranging between 20-30%. After that, a variety of categories moved in and out of the top slot, with none holding it for more than a few weeks. The biggest spike in attacks was targeted at Travel sites in mid-April, when more than half of the category’s traffic was mitigated. Coincident with the start of the 2022 World Cup in the last week of November, Gambling and Entertainment sites saw the largest percentages of mitigated traffic.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/29.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year in Review"></figure><p>For attacks coming from the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/gb#content-category-attack-distribution">United Kingdom</a>, Technology sites consistently saw around 20% of mitigated traffic through the year. During those times that it was not the most mitigated category, half a dozen other categories topped the list. Travel sites experienced two significant bursts of attacks, with nearly 60% of traffic mitigated in April, and nearly 50% in October. Other categories, including Government &amp; Politics, Real Estate, Religion, and Education had the largest shares of mitigated traffic at various times throughout the year. UK-originated attacks on Entertainment sites jumped significantly in late November, with 40% of traffic mitigated at the end of the month.</p><p>Similar to the trends seen at the global level, Technology sites accounted for the largest percentage of mitigated attacks from the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/us#content-category-attack-distribution">United States</a> in January and February, clocking in between 30-40%. After that, attackers shifted their focus to target other industry categories. In mid-April, Travel sites had over 60% of requests mitigated as attacks. However, starting in May, Gambling sites most frequently had the highest percentage of traffic being mitigated, generally ranging between 20-40%, but spiking up to 70% in late October/early November.</p><p>In contrast, significantly smaller percentages of traffic across the surveyed categories from <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022/jp#content-category-attack-distribution">Japan</a> was mitigated as attacks throughout 2022. Most categories saw mitigation shares of less than 10%, although there were a number of brief spikes observed at times. In late March, traffic to sites in the Government &amp; Politics category briefly jumped to a nearly 80% mitigation share, while Travel sites spiked to nearly 70% of requests mitigated as attacks, similar to the behavior seen in other locations. In late June, Religion sites had a mitigation share of over 60%, and a couple of months later, Gambling sites experienced a rapid increase in mitigated traffic, reaching just over 40%. These attacks targeting Gambling sites then receded for a few months before starting to aggressively increase again in October.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3><a id="phishing"></a>Phishing email sources</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Phishing emails are ultimately intended to trick users into providing attackers with login credentials for important websites and applications. At a consumer level, this could include an e-commerce site or banking application, while for businesses, this could include code repositories or employee information systems. For customers protected by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/email-security/">Cloudflare Area 1 Email Security</a>, we can identify the location that these phishing emails are being sent from. IP address geolocation is used to identify origination location, and the aggregate email counts apply to emails processed by Area 1 only. For the top 10 chart, we aggregated the number of phishing emails seen on a weekly basis per location, and then ranked the locations by phishing email volume. The chart illustrates the ranking by week, and how those rankings change across the year.</p><p>Reviewing the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022#top-phishing-email-source-locations">top 10 list</a>, we find that the United States was the top source of phishing emails observed by Area 1 during 2022. It held the top spot for nearly the entire year, ceding it only once to Germany in November. The balance of the top 10 saw a significant amount of volatility over time, with a total of 23 locations holding a spot in the rankings for at least one month during the year. These locations were well-distributed geographically across the Americas, Europe, and Asia, highlighting that no one region of the world is a greater threat than others. Obviously, distrusting or rejecting all email originating from these locations is not a particularly practical response, but applying additional scrutiny can help keep your organization, and the Internet, safer.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Attempting to concisely summarize our “year in review” observations is challenging, especially as we only looked at trends in this blog post across a small fraction of the nearly 200 locations included in the website’s visualizations. Having said that, we will leave you with the following brief thoughts:</p><ul><li>Attack traffic comes from everywhere, with constantly shifting targets, using widely varied techniques. Ensure that your security solutions provider offers a comprehensive portfolio of services to help keep your sites, applications, and infrastructure safe.</li><li>Internet service providers around the world need to improve support for IPv6 — it is no longer a “new” technology, and available IPv4 address space will become both increasingly scarce and increasingly expensive. Support for IPv6 needs to become the default going forward.</li><li>Internet shutdowns are being increasingly used by governments to limit communications within a country, as well as limiting communications with the rest of the world. As the United Nations stated in a <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G22/341/55/PDF/G2234155.pdf?OpenElement">May 2022 report</a>, “Blanket shutdowns in particular inherently impose unacceptable consequences for human rights and should never be imposed.”</li></ul><p>As we said in the introduction, we encourage you to visit the full <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2022">Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year In Review website</a> and explore the trends relevant to locations and industries of interest, and to consider how they impact your organization so that you are appropriately prepared for 2023.</p><p>If you have any questions, you can contact the Cloudflare Radar team at <a href="mailto:radar@cloudflare.com">radar@cloudflare.com</a> or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/cloudflareradar">@CloudflareRadar</a>.</p><h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2><p>It truly took a village to produce the Cloudflare Radar 2022 Year In Review, and we would be remiss if we didn’t acknowledge the contributions of colleagues that were instrumental in making this project possible.

Users on the Pro, Business and Enterprise plan will also be able to tag DNS records.</p><h3 id="dns-records-are-important">DNS records are important</h3><p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/">DNS records</a> play an essential role when it comes to operating a website or a web application. In general, they are used to mapping human-readable hostnames to machine-readable information, most commonly IP addresses. Besides mapping hostnames to IP addresses they also fulfill many other use cases like:</p><ul><li>Ensuring emails can reach your inbox, by setting up MX records.</li><li><a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/tackling-email-spoofing/">Avoiding email spoofing and phishing</a> by configuring <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/">SPF</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dmarc-record/">DMARC</a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dkim-record/">DKIM</a> policies as TXT records.</li><li>Validating a TLS certificate by adding a TXT (or CNAME) record.</li><li>Specifying allowed certificate authorities that can issue certificates on behalf of your domain by creating a CAA record.</li><li>Validating ownership of your domain for other web services (website hosting, email hosting, web storage, etc.) - usually by creating a TXT record.</li><li>And many more.</li></ul><p>With all these different use cases, it is easy to forget what a particular DNS record is for and it is not always possible to derive the purpose from the name, type and content of a record. Validation TXT records tend to be on seemingly arbitrary names with rather cryptic content. When you then also throw multiple people or teams into the mix who have access to the same domain, all creating and updating DNS records, it can quickly happen that someone modifies or even deletes a record causing the on-call person to get paged in the middle of the night.</p><h3 id="enter-dns-record-comments-tags-">Enter: DNS record comments &amp; tags 📝</h3><p>Starting today, everyone with a zone on Cloudflare can add custom comments on each of their DNS records <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/dns-records-for-a-zone-create-dns-record">via the API</a> and through the Cloudflare dashboard.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image3-26.png" class="kg-image" alt="One of our most requested features is here: DNS record comments and tags"></figure><p>To add a comment, just click on the Edit action of the respective DNS record and fill out the Comment field. Once you hit Save, a small icon will appear next to the record name to remind you that this record has a comment. Hovering over the icon will allow you to take a quick glance at it without having to open the edit panel.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/unnamed-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="One of our most requested features is here: DNS record comments and tags"></figure><p>What you also can see in the screenshot above is the new Tags field. All users on the Pro, Business, or Enterprise plans now have the option to add custom tags to their records. These tags can be just a key like “important” or a key-value pair like “team:DNS” which is separated by a colon. Neither comments nor tags have any impact on the resolution or propagation of the particular DNS record, and they’re only visible to people with access to the zone.</p><p>Now we know that some of our users love automation by using our API. So if you want to create a number of zones and populate all their DNS records by uploading a zone file as part of your script, you can also directly include the DNS record comments and tags in that zone file. And when you export a zone file, either to back up all records of your zone or to easily move your zone to another account on Cloudflare, it will also contain comments and tags. Learn more about importing and exporting comments and tags on our <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/import-and-export/#dns-record-attributes">developer documentation</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>;; A Records

Sometimes, it’s about democratizing technologies that were previously only available to the wealthiest and most technologically savvy companies, sometimes it’s about protecting the most vulnerable groups from cyber attacks and online prosecution. And the Internet does not exist in a vacuum.</p><p>As a global company, we see the way that the future of the Internet is affected by governments, regulations, and people. If we want to help build a better Internet, we have to make sure that we are in the room, sharing Cloudflare’s perspective in the many places where important conversations about the Internet are happening. And that is why we believe strongly in the value of public policy.</p><p>We thought this week would be a great opportunity to share Cloudflare’s principles and our theories behind policy engagement. Because at its core, a public policy approach needs to reflect who the company is through their actions and rhetoric. And as a company, we believe there is real value in helping governments understand how companies work, and helping our employees understand how governments and law-makers work. Especially now, during a time in which many jurisdictions are passing far-reaching laws that shape the future of the Internet, from laws on content moderation, to new and more demanding regulations on cybersecurity.</p><h3 id="principled-curious-transparent">Principled, Curious, Transparent</h3><p>At Cloudflare, we have three core company values: we are Principled, Curious, and Transparent. By principled, we mean thoughtful, consistent, and long-term oriented about what the right course of action is. By curious, we mean taking on big challenges and understanding the why and how behind things. Finally, by transparent, we mean being clear on why and how we decide to do things both internally and externally.</p><p>Our approach to public policy aims to integrate these three values into our engagement with stakeholders. We are thoughtful when choosing the right issues to prioritize, and are consistent once we have chosen to take a position on a particular topic. We are curious about the important policy conversations that governments and institutions around the world are having about the future of the Internet, and want to understand the different points of view in that debate. And we aim to be as transparent as possible when talking about our policy stances, by, for example, writing blogs, submitting comments to public consultations, or participating in conversations with policymakers and our peers in the industry. And, for instance with this blog, we also aim to be transparent about our actual advocacy efforts.</p><h3 id="what-makes-cloudflare-different">What makes Cloudflare different?</h3><p>With approximately 20 percent of websites using our service, including those who use our free tier, Cloudflare protects a wide variety of customers from cyberattack. Our business model relies on economies of scale, and customers choosing to add products and services to our entry-level cybersecurity protections. This means our policy perspective can be broad: we are advocating for a better Internet for our customers who are Fortune 1000 companies, as well as for individual developers with hobby blogs or small business websites. It also means that our perspective is distinct: we have a business model that is unique, and therefore a perspective that often isn’t represented by others.</p><h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3><p>We are not naive: we do not believe that a growing company can command the same attention as some of the Internet giants, or has the capacity to engage on as many issues as those bigger companies. So how do we prioritize? What’s our rule of thumb on how and when we engage?</p><p>Our starting point is to think about the policy developments that have the largest impact on our own activities. Which issues could force us to change our model? Cause significant (financial) impact? Skew incentives for stronger cybersecurity? Then we do the exercise again, this time, thinking about whether our perspective on that policy issue is dramatically different from those of other companies in the industry. Is it important to us, but we share the same perspective as other cybersecurity, infrastructure, or cloud companies? We pass. For example, while changing corporate tax rates could have a significant financial impact on our business, we don’t exactly have a unique perspective on that. So that’s off the list. But privacy? There we think we have a distinct perspective, as a company that practices privacy by design, and supports and develops standards that help ensure privacy on the Internet. And crucially: we think privacy will be critical to the future of the Internet. So on public policy ideas related to privacy we engage. And then there is our unique vantage point, derived from our global network. This often gives us important insight and data, which we can use to educate policymakers on relevant issues.</p><h3 id="our-engagement-channels">Our engagement channels</h3><p>Our Public Policy team includes people who have worked in government, law firms and the tech industry before they joined Cloudflare. The informal networks, professional relationships, and expertise that they have built over the course of their careers are instrumental in ensuring that Cloudflare is involved in important policy conversations about the Internet. We do not have a Political Action Committee, and we do not make political contributions.</p><p>As mentioned, we try to focus on the issues where we can make a difference, where we have a unique interest, perspective and expertise. Nonetheless, there are many policies and regulations that could affect not only us at Cloudflare, but the entire Internet ecosystem. In order to track policy developments worldwide, and ensure that we are able to share information, we are members of a number of associations and coalitions.</p><p>Some of these advocacy groups represent a particular industry, such as software companies, or US based technology firms, and engage with lawmakers on a wide variety of relevant policy issues for their particular sector. Other groups, in contrast, focus their advocacy on a more specific policy issue.</p><p>In addition to formal trade association memberships, we will occasionally join coalitions of companies or civil society organizations assembled for particular advocacy purposes. For example, we periodically engage with the Stronger Internet coalition, to share information about policies around encryption, privacy, and free expression around the world.</p><p>It almost goes without saying that, given our commitment to transparency as a company and entirely in line with our own ethics code and legal compliance, we fully comply with all relevant rules around advocacy in jurisdictions across the world. You can also find us in transparency registers of governmental entities, where these exist. Because we want to be transparent about how we advocate for a better Internet, today we have published an overview of the organizations we work with on our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/trade-association-memberships/">website</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The unintended consequences of blocking IP addresses]]></title><description><![CDATA[A discussion about IP blocking: why we see it, what it is, what it does, who it affects, and why it’s such a problematic way to address content online.]]></description><link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/consequences-of-ip-blocking/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">639c63845a028f000abbdcef</guid><category><![CDATA[Impact Week]]></category><category><![CDATA[IP]]></category><category><![CDATA[Better Internet]]></category><category><![CDATA[Internet Performance]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alissa Starzak]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image1-52.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image1-52.png" alt="The unintended consequences of blocking IP addresses"><p><em><small>This post is also available in <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/zh-cn/consequences-of-ip-blocking-zh-cn/">简体中文</a>, <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/de-de/consequences-of-ip-blocking-de-de/">Deutsch</a>, <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/es-es/consequences-of-ip-blocking-es-es/">Español</a> and <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/pt-br/consequences-of-ip-blocking-pt-br/">Português</a> and <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/ru-ru/consequences-of-ip-blocking-ru-ru/">Pусский</a>.</small></em></p>

Our team immediately went into action to try to identify the source of what looked from the outside like a partial Internet outage in Austria. We quickly realized that it was an issue with local Austrian Internet Service Providers.</p><p>But the service disruption wasn’t the result of a technical problem.

Without any notice to Cloudflare, an Austrian court had ordered Austrian Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block 11 of Cloudflare’s IP addresses.</p><p>In an attempt to block 14 websites that copyright holders argued were violating copyright, the court-ordered IP block rendered thousands of websites inaccessible to ordinary Internet users in Austria over a two-day period. What did the thousands of other sites do wrong? Nothing. They were a temporary casualty of the failure to build legal remedies and systems that reflect the Internet’s actual architecture.</p><p>Today, we are going to dive into a discussion of IP blocking: why we see it, what it is, what it does, who it affects, and why it’s such a problematic way to address content online.</p><h2 id="collateral-effects-large-and-small">Collateral effects, large and small</h2><p>The craziest thing is that this type of blocking happens on a regular basis, all around the world. But unless that blocking happens at the scale of what happened in Austria, or someone decides to highlight it, it is typically invisible to the outside world. Even Cloudflare, with deep technical expertise and understanding about how blocking works, can’t routinely see when an IP address is blocked.</p><p>For Internet users, it’s even more opaque. They generally don’t know why they can’t connect to a particular website, where the connection problem is coming from, or how to address it. They simply know they cannot access the site they were trying to visit. And that can make it challenging to document when sites have become inaccessible because of IP address blocking.</p><p>Blocking practices are also wide-spread. In their Freedom on the Net report, Freedom House recently <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2022/key-internet-controls">reported</a> that 40 out of the 70 countries that they examined - which vary from countries like Russia, Iran and Egypt to Western democracies like the United Kingdom and Germany -  did some form of website blocking. Although the report doesn’t delve into exactly how those countries block, many of them use forms of IP blocking, with the same kind of potential effects for a partial Internet shutdown that we saw in Austria.</p><p>Although it can be challenging to assess the amount of collateral damage from IP blocking, we do have examples where organizations have attempted to quantify it. In conjunction with a case before the European Court of Human Rights, the European Information Society Institute, a Slovakia-based nonprofit, reviewed Russia’s regime for website blocking in 2017. Russia exclusively used IP addresses to block content. The European Information Society Institute concluded that IP blocking led to “<em>collateral website blocking on a massive scale</em>” and noted that as of June 28, 2017, “6,522,629 Internet resources had been blocked in Russia, of which 6,335,850 – or 97% – had been blocked collaterally, that is to say, without legal justification.”</p><p>In the UK, overbroad blocking prompted the non-profit Open Rights Group to create the website <a href="https://www.blocked.org.uk/">Blocked.org.uk</a>. The website has a tool enabling users and site owners to report on overblocking and request that ISPs remove blocks. The group also has hundreds of individual stories about the effect of blocking on those whose websites were inappropriately blocked, from charities to small business owners. Although it’s not always clear what blocking methods are being used, the fact that the site is necessary at all conveys the amount of overblocking. Imagine a dressmaker, watchmaker or car dealer looking to advertise their services and potentially gain new customers with their website. That doesn’t work if local users can’t access the site.</p><p>One reaction might be, “Well, just make sure there are no restricted sites sharing an address with unrestricted sites.” But as we’ll discuss in more detail, this ignores the large difference between the number of possible domain names and the number of available IP addresses, and runs counter to the very technical specifications that empower the Internet. Moreover, the definitions of restricted and unrestricted differ across nations, communities, and organizations. Even if it were possible to know all the restrictions, the designs of the protocols -- of the Internet, itself -- mean that it is simply infeasible, if not impossible, to satisfy every agency’s constraints.</p><h2 id="legal-and-human-rights-concerns">Legal and human rights concerns</h2><p>Overblocking websites is not only a problem for users; it has legal implications. Because of the effect it can have on ordinary citizens looking to exercise their rights online, government entities (both courts and regulatory bodies) have a legal obligation to make sure that their orders are necessary and proportionate, and don’t unnecessarily affect those who are not contributing to the harm.</p><p>It would be hard to imagine, for example, that a court in response to alleged wrongdoing would blindly issue a search warrant or an order based solely on a street address without caring if that address was for a single family home, a six-unit condo building, or a high rise with hundreds of separate units. But those sorts of practices with IP addresses appear to be rampant.</p><p>In 2020, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) - the court overseeing the implementation of the Council of Europe’s European Convention on Human Rights - considered a case involving a website that was blocked in Russia not because it had been targeted by the Russian government, but because it shared an IP address with a blocked website. The website owner brought suit over the block. The ECHR concluded that the indiscriminate blocking was impermissible, ruling that the block on the lawful content of the site “<em>amounts to arbitrary interference with the rights of owners of such websites</em>.” In other words, the ECHR ruled that it was improper for a government to issue orders that resulted in the blocking of sites that were not targeted.</p><h2 id="using-internet-infrastructure-to-address-content-challenges">Using Internet infrastructure to address content challenges</h2><p>Ordinary Internet users don’t think a lot about how the content they are trying to access online is delivered to them. They assume that when they type a domain name into their browser, the content will automatically pop up. And if it doesn’t, they tend to assume the website itself is having problems unless their entire Internet connection seems to be broken. But those basic assumptions ignore the reality that connections to a website are often used to limit access to content online.</p><p>Why do countries block connections to websites? Maybe they want to limit their own citizens from accessing what they believe to be illegal content - like online gambling or explicit material - that is permissible elsewhere in the world. Maybe they want to prevent the viewing of a foreign news source that they believe to be primarily disinformation. Or maybe they want to support copyright holders seeking to block access to a website to limit viewing of content that they believe infringes their intellectual property.</p><p>To be clear, <strong>blocking access is not the same thing as removing content from the Internet</strong>. There are a variety of legal obligations and authorities designed to permit actual removal of illegal content. Indeed, the legal expectation in many countries is that blocking is a matter of last resort, after attempts have been made to remove content at the source.</p><p>Blocking just prevents certain viewers - those whose Internet access depends on the ISP that is doing the blocking - from being able to access websites. The site itself continues to exist online and is accessible by everyone else. But when the content originates from a different place and can’t be easily removed, a country may see blocking as their best or only approach.</p><p>We recognize the concerns that sometimes drive countries to implement blocking. But fundamentally, we believe it’s important for users to know when the websites they are trying to access have been blocked, and, to the extent possible, who has blocked them from view and why. And it’s critical that any restrictions on content should be as limited as possible to address the harm, to avoid infringing on the rights of others.</p><p>Brute force IP address blocking doesn’t allow for those things. It’s fully opaque to Internet users. The practice has unintended, unavoidable consequences on other content. And the very fabric of the Internet means that there is no good way to identify what other websites might be affected either before or during an IP block.</p><p>To understand what happened in Austria and what happens in many other countries around the world that seek to block content with the bluntness of IP addresses, we have to understand what is going on behind the scenes. That means diving into some technical details.</p><h2 id="identity-is-attached-to-names-never-addresses">Identity is attached to names, never addresses</h2><p>Before we even get started describing the technical realities of blocking, it’s important to stress that the first and best option to deal with content is at the source. A website owner or hosting provider has the option of removing content at a granular level, without having to take down an entire website. On the more technical side, a domain name registrar or registry can potentially withdraw a domain name, and therefore a website, from the Internet altogether.</p><p>But how do you block access to a website, if for whatever reason the content owner or content source is unable or unwilling to remove it from the Internet?  There are only three possible control points.</p><p>The first is via the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates domain names into IP addresses so that the site can be found. Instead of returning a valid IP address for a domain name, the DNS resolver could lie and respond with a code, NXDOMAIN, meaning that “there is no such name.” A better approach would be to use one of the honest error numbers <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8914/">standardized in 2020</a>, including error 15 for blocked, error 16 for censored, 17 for filtered, or 18 for prohibited, although these are not widely used currently.</p><p>Interestingly, the precision and effectiveness of DNS as a control point depends on whether the DNS resolver is private or public. Private or ‘internal’ DNS resolvers are operated by ISPs and enterprise environments for their own known clients, which means that operators can be precise in applying content restrictions. By contrast, that level of precision is unavailable to open or public resolvers, not least because routing and addressing is global and ever-changing on the Internet map, and in stark contrast to addresses and routes on a fixed postal or street map. For example, private DNS resolvers may be able to block access to websites within specified geographic regions with at least some level of accuracy in a way that public DNS resolvers cannot, which becomes profoundly important given the disparate (and inconsistent) blocking regimes around the world.</p><p>The second approach is to block individual connection requests to a restricted domain name. When a user or client wants to visit a website, a connection is initiated from the client to a server <em>name</em>, i.e. the domain name. If a network or on-path device is able to observe the server name, then the connection can be terminated. Unlike DNS, there is no mechanism to communicate to the user that access to the server name was blocked, or why.</p><p>The third approach is to block access to an IP address where the domain name can be found. This is a bit like blocking the delivery of all mail to a physical address. Consider, for example, if that address is a skyscraper with its many unrelated and independent occupants. Halting delivery of mail to the address of the skyscraper causes collateral damage by invariably affecting all parties at that address. IP addresses work the same way.</p><p>Notably, the IP address is the only one of the three options that has no attachment to the domain name. The website domain name is not required for routing and delivery of data packets; in fact it is fully ignored. A website can be available on any IP address, or even on many IP addresses, simultaneously. And the set of IP addresses that a website is on can change at any time. The set of IP addresses cannot <em>definitively</em> be known by querying DNS, which has been able to return any valid address at any time for any reason, since <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc1794/">1995</a>.</p><p>The idea that an address is representative of an identity is anathema to the Internet’s design, because the decoupling of address from name is deeply embedded in the Internet standards and protocols, as is explained next.</p><h2 id="the-internet-is-a-set-of-protocols-not-a-policy-or-perspective">The Internet is a set of protocols, not a policy or perspective</h2><p>Many people still incorrectly assume that an IP address represents a single website. We’ve previously <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/addressing-agility/">stated</a> that the association between names and addresses is understandable given that the earliest connected components of the Internet appeared as one computer, one interface, one address, and one name. This one-to-one association was an artifact of the ecosystem in which the Internet Protocol was deployed, and satisfied the needs of the time.</p><p>Despite the one-to-one naming practice of the early Internet, it has always been possible to assign more than one name to a server (or ‘host’). For example, a server was (and is still) often configured with names to reflect its service offerings such as <code>mail.example.com</code> and <code>www.example.com</code>, but these shared a base domain name.  There were few reasons to have completely different domain names until the need to colocate completely different websites onto a single server. That practice was made easier in 1997 by the <strong>Host</strong> header in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2068/">HTTP/1.1</a>, a feature preserved by the SNI field in a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc3546/">TLS extension</a> in 2003.</p><p>Throughout these changes, the Internet Protocol and, separately, the DNS protocol, have not only kept pace, but have remained fundamentally unchanged. They are the very reason that the Internet has been able to scale and evolve, because they are about addresses, reachability, and arbitrary name to IP address relationships.</p><p>The designs of IP and DNS are also entirely independent, which only reinforces that names are separate from addresses. A closer inspection of the protocols’ design elements illuminates the misperceptions of policies that lead to today's common practice of controlling access to content by blocking IP addresses.</p><h3 id="by-design-ip-is-for-reachability-and-nothing-else">By design, IP is for reachability and nothing else</h3><p>Much like large public civil engineering projects rely on building codes and best practice, the Internet is built using a set of <em>open</em> standards and specifications informed by experience and agreed by international consensus. The Internet standards that connect hardware and applications are published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>) in the form of “Requests for Comment” or <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/">RFCs</a> -- so named not to suggest incompleteness, but to reflect that standards must be able to evolve with knowledge and experience. The IETF and its RFCs are cemented in the very fabric of communications, for example, with the first RFC 1 published in 1969. The Internet Protocol (IP) specification reached <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc791/">RFC status</a> in 1981.</p><p>Alongside the standards organizations, the Internet’s success has been helped by a core idea known as the end-to-end (e2e) principle, <a href="https://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/endtoend.pdf">codified</a> also in 1981, based on years of trial and error <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">experience</a>. The end-to-end principle is a powerful abstraction that, despite taking many forms, manifests a core notion of the Internet Protocol specification: the network’s only responsibility is to establish reachability, and every other possible feature has a cost or a risk.</p><p>The idea of “reachability” in the Internet Protocol is also enshrined in the design of IP addresses themselves. Looking at the Internet Protocol specification, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791">RFC 791</a>, the following excerpt from Section 2.3 is explicit about IP addresses having no association with names, interfaces, or anything else.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>Addressing

    A distinction is made between names, addresses, and routes [4].   A
    name indicates what we seek.  An address indicates where it is.  A

    primarily with addresses.  It is the task of higher level (i.e.,
    host-to-host or application) protocols to make the mapping from
    names to addresses.   The internet module maps internet addresses to
    local net addresses.  It is the task of lower level (i.e., local net

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Just like postal addresses for skyscrapers in the physical world, IP addresses are no more than street addresses written on a piece of paper. And just like a street address on paper, one can never be confident about the entities or organizations that exist behind an IP address. In a network like Cloudflare’s, any single IP address represents <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-architecture-and-how-bpf-eats-the-world/">thousands of servers</a>, and can have even more websites and services -- in some cases numbering into the <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/addressing-agility/">millions</a> -- expressly because the Internet Protocol is designed to enable it.</p><p>Here’s an interesting question: could we, or any content service provider, ensure that every IP address matches to one and only one name? The answer is an unequivocal <strong>no</strong>, and here too, because of a protocol design -- in this case, DNS.</p><h3 id="the-number-of-names-in-dns-always-exceeds-the-available-addresses">The number of names in DNS always exceeds the available addresses</h3><p>A one-to-one relationship between names and addresses is impossible given the Internet specifications for the same reasons that it is infeasible in the physical world. Ignore for a moment that people and organizations can change addresses. Fundamentally, the number of people and organizations on the planet exceeds the number of postal addresses. We not only want, but <em>need</em> for the Internet to accommodate more names than addresses.</p><p>The difference in magnitude between names and addresses is also codified in the specifications. IPv4 addresses are 32 bits, and IPv6 addresses are 128 bits. The size of a domain name that can be queried by DNS is as many as 253 octets, or 2,024 bits (from Section 2.3.4 in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc1035/">RFC 1035</a>, published 1987). The table below helps to put those differences into perspective:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-16-at-13.02.04.png" class="kg-image" alt="The unintended consequences of blocking IP addresses"></figure><p>On November 15, 2022, the United Nations announced the population of the Earth surpassed eight billion people. Intuitively, we know that there cannot be anywhere near as many postal addresses. The difference between the number of possible names on the planet, and similarly on the Internet, does and must exceed the number of available addresses.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="theproofisinthepuddingnames">The proof is in the <s>pudding</s> names!</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Now that those two relevant principles about IP addresses and DNS names in the international standards are understood - that IP address and domain names serve distinct purposes and there is no one to one relationship between the two - an examination of a recent case of content blocking using IP addresses can help to see the reasons it is problematic. Take, for example, the IP blocking incident in Austria late August 2022. The goal was to restrict access to 14 target domains, by blocking 11 IP addresses (source: RTR.Telekom. Post via the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220828220559/http://netzsperre.liwest.at/">Internet Archive</a>) -- the mismatch between those two numbers should have been a warning flag that IP blocking might not have the desired effect.</p><p>Analogies and international standards may explain the reasons that IP blocking should be avoided, but we can see the scale of the problem by looking at Internet-scale data. To better understand and explain the severity of IP blocking, we decided to generate a global view of domain names and IP addresses (thanks are due to a PhD research intern, Sudheesh Singanamalla, for the effort). In September 2022, we used the authoritative zone files for the top-level domains (TLDs) .com, .net, .info, and .org, together with top-1M website lists, to find a total of 255,315,270 unique names. We then queried DNS from each of five regions and recorded the set of IP addresses returned. The table below summarizes our findings:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image3-23.png" class="kg-image" alt="The unintended consequences of blocking IP addresses"></figure><p>The table above makes clear that it takes no more than 10.7 million addresses to reach 255,315,270 million names from any region on the planet, and the total set of IP addresses for those names from everywhere is about 16 million -- the ratio of names to IP addresses is nearly 24x in Europe and 16x globally.</p><p>There is one more worthwhile detail about the numbers above: The IP addresses are the combined totals of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, meaning that far fewer addresses are needed to reach all 255M websites.</p><p>We’ve also inspected the data a few different ways to find some interesting observations. For example, the figure below shows the cumulative distribution (CDF) of the proportion of websites that can be visited with each additional IP address. On the y-axis is the proportion of websites that can be reached given some number of IP addresses. On the x-axis, the 16M IP addresses are ranked from the most domains on the left, to the least domains on the right. Note that any IP address in this set is a response from DNS and so it must have at least one domain name, but the highest numbers of domains on IP addresses in the set number are in the 8-digit millions.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image2-37.png" class="kg-image" alt="The unintended consequences of blocking IP addresses"></figure><p>By looking at the CDF there are a few eye-watering observations:</p><ul><li>Fewer than 10 IP addresses are needed to reach 20% of, or approximately 51 million, domains in the set;</li><li>100 IPs are enough to reach almost 50% of domains;</li><li>1000 IPs are enough to reach 60% of domains;</li><li>10,000 IPs are enough to reach 80%, or about 204 million, domains.</li></ul><p>In fact, from the total set of 16 million addresses, fewer than half, 7.1M (43.7%), of the addresses in the dataset had one name. On this ‘one’ point we must be additionally clear: we are unable to ascertain if there was only one and no other names on those addresses because there are many more domain names than those contained only in .com, .org, .info., and .net -- there might very well be other names on those addresses.</p><p>In addition to having a number of domains on a single IP address, any IP address may change over time for any of those domains.  Changing IP addresses periodically can be helpful with certain security, performance, and to improve reliability for websites. One common example in use by many operations is load balancing. This means DNS queries may return different IP addresses over time, or in different places, for the same websites. This is a further, and separate, reason why blocking based on IP addresses will not serve its intended purpose over time.</p><p>Ultimately, <strong>there is no reliable way to know the number of domains on an IP address</strong> without inspecting all names in the DNS, from every location on the planet, at every moment in time -- an entirely infeasible proposition.</p><p>Any action on an IP address must, by the very definitions of the protocols that rule and empower the Internet, be expected to have collateral effects.</p><h2 id="lack-of-transparency-with-ip-blocking">Lack of transparency with IP blocking</h2><p>So if we have to expect that the blocking of an IP address will have collateral effects, and it’s generally agreed that it’s inappropriate or even legally impermissible to overblock by blocking IP addresses that have multiple domains on them, why does it still happen? That’s hard to know for sure, so we can only speculate. Sometimes it reflects a lack of technical understanding about the possible effects, particularly from entities like judges who are not technologists. Sometimes governments just ignore the collateral damage - as they do with Internet shutdowns - because they see the blocking as in their interest. And when there is collateral damage, it’s not usually obvious to the outside world, so there can be very little external pressure to have it addressed.</p><p>It’s worth stressing that point. When an IP is blocked, a user just sees a failed connection. They don’t know why the connection failed, or who caused it to fail. On the other side, the server acting on behalf of the website doesn’t even know it’s been blocked until it starts getting complaints about the fact that it is unavailable. There is virtually no transparency or accountability for the overblocking. And it can be challenging, if not impossible, for a website owner to challenge a block or seek redress for being inappropriately blocked.</p><p>Some governments, including <a href="https://www.rtr.at/TKP/was_wir_tun/telekommunikation/weitere-regulierungsthemen/netzneutralitaet/nn_blockings.de.html">Austria</a>, do publish active block lists, which is an important step for transparency. But for all the reasons we’ve discussed, publishing an IP address does not reveal all the sites that may have been blocked unintentionally. And it doesn’t give those affected a means to challenge the overblocking. Again, in the physical world example, it’s hard to imagine a court order on a skyscraper that wouldn’t be posted on the door, but we often seem to jump over such due process and notice requirements in virtual space.</p><p>We think talking about the problematic consequences of IP blocking is more important than ever as an increasing number of countries push to block content online. Unfortunately, ISPs often use IP blocks to implement those requirements. It may be that the ISP is newer or less robust than larger counterparts, but larger ISPs engage in the practice, too, and understandably so because IP blocking takes the least effort and is readily available in most equipment.</p><p>And as more and more domains are included on the same number of IP addresses, the problem is only going to get worse.</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2><p>So what can we do?</p><p>We believe the first step is to improve transparency around the use of IP blocking. Although we’re not aware of any comprehensive way to document the collateral damage caused by IP blocking, we believe there are steps we can take to expand awareness of the practice. We are committed to working on new initiatives that highlight those insights, as we’ve done with the Cloudflare Radar Outage Center.</p><p>We also recognize that this is a whole Internet problem, and therefore has to be part of a broader effort. The significant likelihood that blocking by IP address will result in restricting access to a whole series of unrelated (and untargeted) domains should make it a non-starter for everyone. That’s why we’re engaging with civil society partners and like-minded companies to lend their voices to challenge the use of blocking IP addresses as a way of addressing content challenges and to point out collateral damage when they see it.</p><p>To be clear, to address the challenges of illegal content online, countries need legal mechanisms that enable the removal or restriction of content in a rights-respecting way. We believe that addressing the content at the source is almost always the best and the required first step. Laws like the EU’s new Digital Services Act or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act provide tools that can be used to address illegal content at the source, while respecting important due process principles. Governments should focus on building and applying legal mechanisms in ways that least affect other people’s rights, consistent with human rights expectations.</p><p>Very simply, these needs cannot be met by blocking IP addresses.</p><p>We’ll continue to look for new ways to talk about network activity and disruption, particularly when it results in unnecessary limitations on access.

We wanted a Third Party Code of Conduct that serves as a statement of Cloudflare’s core values and commitments, and a call for third parties who share the same.</p><p>The following are just a few examples of how we want to ensure our third parties act with ethics and integrity on our behalf, even when we aren’t watching:</p><p>We want to ensure that the servers and other equipment in our supply chain are sourced responsibly, from manufacturers who respect human rights — free of forced or child labor, with environmental <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/extending-the-life-of-hardware/">sustainability at the forefront</a>.</p><p>We want to provide our products and services to customers based on the quality of Cloudflare, not because a third party reseller may bribe a customer to enter into an agreement.</p><p>We want to ensure there are no conflicts of interest with our third parties, that might give someone an unfair advantage.</p><p>As a government contractor, we want to ensure that we do not have telecommunications or video surveillance equipment, systems, or services from prohibited parties in our supply chain to protect national security interests.</p><p>Having a Third Party Code of Conduct is also industry standard. As Cloudflare garners an increasing number of Fortune 500 and other enterprise customers, we find ourselves reviewing and committing to their Third Party Codes of Conduct as well.</p><h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3><p>Our Third Party Code of Conduct is not meant to replace our <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/terms/">terms of service</a> or other contractual agreements. Rather, it is meant to supplement them, highlighting Cloudflare’s ethical commitments and encouraging our suppliers, resellers, and other partners to commit to the same. We will be cascading this new Code to all existing third parties, and include it at onboarding for all new third parties going forward. A violation of the Code, or any contractual agreements between Cloudflare and our third parties, may result in termination of the relationship.</p><p>This Third Party Code of Conduct is only one facet of Cloudflare’s third party due diligence program, and it complements the other work that Cloudflare does in this area. Cloudflare rigorously screens and vets our suppliers and partners at onboarding, and we continue to routinely monitor and audit them over time. We are always looking for ways to communicate with, educate, and learn from our third parties as well.</p><h3 id="join-our-mission">Join our mission</h3><p>Are you a supplier, reseller or other partner who shares these values of ethics and integrity?

However, despite its vital function, BGP wasn't originally designed to protect against malicious actors or routing mishaps. It has since been updated to account for this shortcoming with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure">Resource Public Key Infrastructure</a> (RPKI) framework, but can we declare it to be safe yet?</p><p>If the question needs asking, you might suspect we can't. There is a shortage of reliable data on how much of the Internet is protected from preventable routing problems. Today, we’re releasing a new method to measure exactly that: what percentage of Internet users are protected by their Internet Service Provider from these issues. We find that there is a long way to go before the Internet is protected from routing problems, though it varies dramatically by country.</p><h3 id="why-rpki-is-necessary-to-secure-internet-routing">Why RPKI is necessary to secure Internet routing</h3><p>The Internet is a network of independently-managed networks, called <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/">Autonomous Systems (ASes)</a>. To achieve global reachability, ASes interconnect with each other and determine the feasible paths to a given destination IP address by exchanging routing information using BGP. BGP enables routers with only local network visibility to construct end-to-end paths based on the arbitrary preferences of each administrative entity that operates that equipment. Typically, Internet traffic between a user and a destination traverses multiple AS networks using paths constructed by BGP routers.</p><p>BGP, however, lacks built-in security mechanisms to protect the integrity of the exchanged routing information and to provide authentication and authorization of the advertised IP address space. Because of this, AS operators must implicitly trust that the routing information exchanged through BGP is accurate. As a result, the Internet is vulnerable to the injection of bogus routing information, which cannot be mitigated by security measures at the client or server level of the network.</p><p>An adversary with access to a BGP router can inject fraudulent routes into the routing system, which can be used to execute an array of attacks, including:</p><ul><li>Denial-of-Service (DoS) through traffic blackholing or redirection,</li><li>Impersonation attacks to eavesdrop on communications,</li><li>Machine-in-the-Middle exploits to modify the exchanged data, and subvert reputation-based filtering systems.</li></ul><p>Additionally, local misconfigurations and fat-finger errors can be propagated well beyond the source of the error and cause major disruption across the Internet.</p><p>Such an incident happened on <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-today/">June 24, 2019</a>. Millions of users were unable to access Cloudflare address space when a regional ISP in Pennsylvania accidentally advertised routes to Cloudflare through their capacity-limited network. This was effectively the Internet equivalent of routing an entire freeway through a neighborhood street.</p><p>Traffic misdirections like these, either unintentional or intentional, are not uncommon. The Internet Society’s <a href="https://www.manrs.org/">MANRS</a> (Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security) initiative estimated that in 2020 alone there were <a href="https://www.manrs.org/2021/03/a-regional-look-into-bgp-incidents-in-2020/">over 3,000 route leaks and hijacks</a>, and new occurrences can be <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/route-leak-detection-with-cloudflare-radar/">observed every day through Cloudflare Radar.</a></p><p>The most prominent proposals to secure BGP routing, standardized by the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/">IETF</a> focus on validating the origin of the advertised routes using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure">Resource Public Key Infrastructure</a> (RPKI) and verifying the integrity of the paths with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGPsec">BGPsec</a>. Specifically, RPKI (defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7115.html">RFC 7115</a>) relies on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure</a> to validate that an AS advertising a route to a destination (an IP address space) is the legitimate owner of those IP addresses.</p><p>RPKI has been defined for a long time but lacks adoption. It requires network operators to cryptographically sign their prefixes, and routing networks to perform an RPKI Route Origin Validation (ROV) on their routers. This is a two-step operation that requires coordination and participation from many actors to be effective.</p><h3 id="the-two-phases-of-rpki-adoption-signing-origins-and-validating-origins">The two phases of RPKI adoption: signing origins and validating origins</h3><p>RPKI has two phases of deployment: first, an AS that wants to protect its own IP prefixes can cryptographically sign Route Origin Authorization (ROA) records thereby attesting to be the legitimate origin of that signed IP space. Second, an AS can avoid selecting invalid routes by performing Route Origin Validation (ROV, defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6483">RFC 6483</a>).</p><p>With ROV, a BGP route received by a neighbor is validated against the available RPKI records. A route that is valid or missing from RPKI is selected, while a route with RPKI records found to be invalid is typically rejected, thus preventing the use and propagation of hijacked and misconfigured routes.</p><p>One issue with RPKI is the fact that implementing ROA is meaningful only if other ASes implement ROV, and vice versa. Therefore, securing BGP routing requires a united effort and a lack of broader adoption disincentivizes ASes from commiting the resources to validate their own routes. Conversely, increasing RPKI adoption can lead to network effects and accelerate RPKI deployment. Projects like MANRS and Cloudflare’s <a href="https://isbgpsafeyet.com/">isbgpsafeyet.com</a> are promoting good Internet citizenship among network operators, and make the benefits of RPKI deployment known to the Internet. You can check whether your own ISP is being a good Internet citizen by testing it on <a href="https://isbgpsafeyet.com/">isbgpsafeyet.com</a>.</p><p>Measuring the extent to which both ROA (signing of addresses by the network that controls them) and ROV (filtering of invalid routes by ISPs) have been implemented is important to evaluating the impact of these initiatives, developing situational awareness, and predicting the impact of future misconfigurations or attacks.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Measuring ROAs is straightforward since ROA data is <a href="https://ftp.ripe.net/rpki/">readily available</a> from RPKI repositories. Querying RPKI repositories for publicly routed IP prefixes (e.g. prefixes visible in the <a href="http://www.routeviews.org/">RouteViews</a> and <a href="https://www.ripe.net/analyse/internet-measurements/routing-information-service-ris">RIPE RIS</a> routing tables) allows us to estimate the percentage of addresses covered by ROA objects. Currently, there are 393,344 IPv4 and 86,306 IPv6 ROAs in the global RPKI system, covering about 40% of the globally routed prefix-AS origin pairs<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Measuring ROV, however, is significantly more challenging given it is configured inside the BGP routers of each AS, not accessible by anyone other than each router’s administrator.</p><h3 id="measuring-rov-deployment">Measuring ROV deployment</h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Although we do not have direct access to the configuration of everyone’s BGP routers, it is possible to infer the use of ROV by comparing the reachability of RPKI-valid and RPKI-invalid prefixes from measurement points within an AS<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Consider the following toy topology as an example, where an RPKI-invalid origin is advertised through AS0 to AS1 and AS2. If AS1 filters and rejects RPKI-invalid routes, a user behind AS1 would not be able to connect to that origin. By contrast, if AS2 does not reject RPKI invalids, a user behind AS2 would be able to connect to that origin.</p><p>While occasionally a user may be unable to access an origin due to transient network issues, if multiple users act as vantage points for a measurement system, we would be able to collect a large number of data points to infer which ASes deploy ROV.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/1-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Helping build a safer Internet by measuring BGP RPKI Route Origin Validation"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>If, in the figure above, AS0 filters invalid RPKI routes, then vantage points in both AS1 and AS2 would be unable to connect to the RPKI-invalid origin, making it hard to distinguish if ROV is deployed at the ASes of our vantage points or in an AS along the path. One way to mitigate this limitation is to announce the RPKI-invalid origin from multiple locations from an anycast network taking advantage of its direct interconnections to the measurement vantage points as shown in the figure below. As a result, an AS that does not itself deploy ROV is less likely to observe the benefits of upstream ASes using ROV, and we would be able to accurately infer ROV deployment per AS<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><em>Note that it’s also important that the IP address of the RPKI-invalid origin should not be covered by a less specific prefix for which there is a valid or unknown RPKI route, otherwise even if an AS filters invalid RPKI routes its users would still be able to find a route to that IP.</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/2-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Helping build a safer Internet by measuring BGP RPKI Route Origin Validation"></figure><p>The measurement technique described here is the one implemented by Cloudflare’s <a href="https://isbgpsafeyet.com">isbgpsafeyet.com</a> website, allowing end users to assess whether or not their ISPs have deployed BGP ROV.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The <a href="https://isbgpsafeyet.com/">isbgpsafeyet.com</a> website itself doesn't submit any data back to Cloudflare, but recently we started measuring whether end users’ browsers can successfully connect to invalid RPKI origins when ROV is present. We use the same mechanism as is used for <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/network-performance-update-developer-week/">global performance data</a><sup>4</sup>. In particular, every measurement session (an individual end user at some point in time) attempts a request to both valid.rpki.cloudflare.com, which should always succeed as it’s RPKI-valid, and invalid.rpki.cloudflare.com, which is RPKI-invalid and should fail when the user’s ISP uses ROV.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This allows us to have continuous and up-to-date measurements from hundreds of thousands of browsers on a daily basis, and develop a greater understanding of the state of ROV deployment.</p><h3 id="the-state-of-global-rov-deployment">The state of global ROV deployment</h3><p>The figure below shows the raw number of ROV probe requests per hour during October 2022 to <em>valid.rpki.cloudflare.com</em> and <em>invalid.rpki.cloudflare.com</em>.

As expected, the number of requests follow a diurnal pattern which reflects established user behavior in daily and weekly Internet activity<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We can also see that the number of successful requests to <em>valid.rpki.cloudflare.com</em> (<em><strong>gray line</strong></em>) closely follows the number of sessions that issued at least one request (<em><strong>blue line</strong></em>), which works as a smoke test for the correctness of our measurements.</p><p>As we don't store the IP addresses that contribute measurements, we don’t have any way to count individual clients and large spikes in the data may introduce unwanted bias. We account for that by capturing those instants and excluding them.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/4-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Helping build a safer Internet by measuring BGP RPKI Route Origin Validation"></figure><p>Overall, we estimate that<strong> </strong>out of the four billion Internet users,<strong> only 261 million (6.5%) are protected by BGP Route Origin Validation</strong>, but the true state of global ROV deployment is more subtle than this.</p><p>The following map shows the fraction of dropped RPKI-invalid requests from ASes with over 200 probes over the month of October. It depicts how far along each country is in adopting ROV but doesn’t necessarily represent the fraction of protected users in each country, as we will discover.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/5-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Helping build a safer Internet by measuring BGP RPKI Route Origin Validation"></figure><p>Sweden and Bolivia appear to be the countries with the highest level of adoption (over 80%), while only a few other countries have crossed the 50% mark (e.g. Finland, Denmark, Chad, Greece, the United States).</p><p>ROV adoption may be driven by a few ASes hosting large user populations, or by many ASes hosting small user populations. To understand such disparities, the map below plots the contrast between overall adoption in a country (as in the previous map) and median adoption over the individual ASes within that country. Countries with stronger reds have relatively few ASes deploying ROV with high impact, while countries with stronger blues have more ASes deploying ROV but with lower impact per AS.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/6-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Helping build a safer Internet by measuring BGP RPKI Route Origin Validation"></figure><p>In the Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, or the United States, adoption appears mostly driven by their larger ASes, while in Greece or Yemen it’s the smaller ones that are adopting ROV.</p><p>The following histogram summarizes the worldwide level of adoption for the 6,765 ASes covered by the previous two maps.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/7.png" class="kg-image" alt="Helping build a safer Internet by measuring BGP RPKI Route Origin Validation"></figure><p>Most ASes either don’t validate at all, or have close to 100% adoption, which is what we’d intuitively expect. However, it's interesting to observe that there are small numbers of ASes all across the scale. ASes that exhibit partial RPKI-invalid drop rate compared to total requests may either implement ROV partially (on some, but not all, of their BGP routers), or appear as dropping RPKI invalids due to ROV deployment by other ASes in their upstream path.</p><p>To estimate the number of users protected by ROV we only considered ASes with an observed adoption above <strong>95%</strong>, as an AS with an incomplete deployment still leaves its users vulnerable to route leaks from its BGP peers.</p><p>If we take the previous histogram and summarize by the number of users behind each AS, the green bar on the right corresponds to the <strong>261 million</strong> users currently protected by ROV according to the above criteria (686 ASes).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/8.png" class="kg-image" alt="Helping build a safer Internet by measuring BGP RPKI Route Origin Validation"></figure><p>Looking back at the country adoption map one would perhaps expect the number of protected users to be larger. But worldwide ROV deployment is still mostly partial, lacking larger ASes, or both. This becomes even more clear when compared with the next map, plotting just the fraction of fully protected users.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/9.png" class="kg-image" alt="Helping build a safer Internet by measuring BGP RPKI Route Origin Validation"></figure><p>To wrap up our analysis, we look at two world economies chosen for their contrasting, almost symmetrical, stages of deployment: the United States and the European Union.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/10.png" class="kg-image" alt="Helping build a safer Internet by measuring BGP RPKI Route Origin Validation"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/11.png" class="kg-image" alt="Helping build a safer Internet by measuring BGP RPKI Route Origin Validation"></figure><p>112 million Internet users are protected by 111 ASes from the United States with comprehensive ROV deployments. Conversely, more than twice as many ASes from countries making up the European Union have fully deployed ROV, but end up covering only half as many users. This can be reasonably explained by end user ASes being more likely to operate within a single country rather than span multiple countries.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Probe requests were performed from end user browsers and very few measurements were collected from transit providers (which have few end users, if any). Also, paths between end user ASes and Cloudflare are often very short (a nice outcome of our extensive peering) and don't traverse upper-tier networks that they would otherwise use to reach the rest of the Internet.</p><p>In other words, the methodology used focuses on ROV adoption by <strong>end user networks</strong> (e.g. ISPs) and isn’t meant to reflect the eventual effect of indirect validation from (perhaps validating) upper-tier transit networks. While indirect validation may limit the "blast radius" of (malicious or accidental) route leaks, it still leaves non-validating ASes vulnerable to leaks coming from their peers.</p><p>As with indirect validation, an AS remains vulnerable until its ROV deployment reaches a sufficient level of completion. We chose to only consider AS deployments above 95% as truly comprehensive, and <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Radar</a> will soon begin using this threshold to track ROV adoption worldwide, as part of our mission to help build a better Internet.</p><p>When considering only comprehensive ROV deployments, some countries such as Denmark, Greece, Switzerland, Sweden, or Australia, already show an effective coverage above 50% of their respective Internet populations, with others like the Netherlands or the United States slightly above 40%, mostly driven by few large ASes rather than many smaller ones.</p><p>Worldwide we observe a very low effective coverage of just <strong>6.5%</strong> over the measured ASes, corresponding to <strong>261 million</strong> end users currently safe from (malicious and accidental) route leaks, which means there’s still a long way to go before we can declare BGP to be safe.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>......<br>

But first, let me start with a personal story.</p><p>Do you remember being in elementary school and sitting in a classroom with about 30 other students when the teacher was calling on your classmates to read out loud from a book? The opportunity to read out loud was an exciting moment for many of my peers; one that made them feel proud of themselves. I, on the other hand, was frozen, in a state of panic, worried that I wouldn’t be able to sound out a word or completely embarrass myself by stuttering. I would practice reading the next paragraph in hopes that I wouldn’t mess up when I was called on. What I didn’t know at the time was that I was dyslexic, and I could barely read, especially out loud to a large group of people.</p><p>That is where I began to know the feeling of isolation. This feeling compounded year after year, when I wasn’t able to perform the way my peers did. My isolation prevailed from elementary school to middle school, through high school and even into college.</p><p>In college, I found a community that changed everything called Eye to Eye - a national non-profit organization that provides mentorship programs for students with learning disabilities. I attended one of their conferences with 200 other students. It was a profound moment when I realized that everyone in the room shared the experience of anxiety and fear around learning. Joining this community made me feel that I was not alone. Community for me is a group of people who have shared experience. Community allowed me to see my learning disability as an asset not a deficit. This is what I think the author, Nilofer Merchant, meant in the <em>11 Rules for Creating Value in the Social Era</em>, when she said "<em>The social object that unites people isn't a company or a product; the social object that most unites people is a shared value or purpose.</em>"</p><p>When I came to work at Cloudflare, I decided to become an ERG leader for Flarability, which provides a space for discussing disability and accessibility at Cloudflare. The same deep sense of community that I felt at Eye to Eye was available to me when I joined Flarability.</p><p>Globally, 85% of the company participates in ERGs and this year alone they hosted over 54 initiatives and events. As the pandemic persisted over the last year, Cloudflare remained a hybrid workforce which posed many challenges for our company culture. ERGs had to rethink the way they foster connection. Today, we are highlighting Persianflare, Afroflare, Greencloud and Desiflare because they have taken different approaches to building community.</p><p>Persianflare is our newest ERG, and in a very short amount of time, ERG Leader Shadnaz Nia has already brought together an entire community of folks who have created lasting impact. Here's how…</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image1-46.png" class="kg-image" alt="The latest from Cloudflare's seventeen Employee Resource Groups"></figure><p><strong>Persianflare: Amplify the voice of Iranian people</strong><br><em>Shadnaz Nia, Solutions Engineer, Toronto</em></p><p><strong>“</strong>Persianflare is the newest ERG which strives to nurture a community for all Persians and allies, where we perpetuate freedom of speech, proudly celebrate rich Persian heritage, appending growth and Persian convention. We have assembled with a desire to amplify the voice of the Iranian people, and bring awareness to human rights violations there, during unprecedented and unbearable times in history.</p><p>Cloudflare’s mission is to build a better Internet and one of our initiatives this year was to support building a better Internet that provides a more private Internet for the people of Iran. At Cloudflare, we are fortunate to have executive leadership that takes action and works tirelessly to provide more uncensored and accessible Internet in countries such as Iran. We’ve done this by offering <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/">WARP</a> solutions in native Farsi language for all Persian-speaking users, empowering them to access uncensored information and news, in turn, strengthening the voice of Persian people living in Iran.</p><p>This project was accidentally routed to my team by the Product Team when they needed a translator. At the time, myself and other Persian employees were feeling powerless as a result of Mahsa Amini being murdered in the custody of the Iranian morality police. This was the birth of Persianflare. Through this project, I started collaborating with other employees and discovered that many of my colleagues really cared about this cause and wanted to help. Throughout the course of this initiative, we found more Persian employees in other regions and let them know about our progress. Words cannot describe how I felt when the app was released.

Our initiatives in 2022 centered on creating and cultivating community by supporting and echoing Black voices and achievements within and outside of Cloudflare. Earlier in the year, given that the pandemic was slowing down but still active, we provided curated content that would allow members and allies to create, contribute and learn about cultures of the African diaspora at their own pace.</p><p>For our celebration of US Black History Month, we aggregated lists of Black-owned businesses and non-profit communities in various cities to support. We also hosted internal chats called “The Plug,” which highlight the immense talent of our members at Cloudflare. Lastly, Afroflare worked with allies to present an Allyship workshop called “Celebrating Black Joy- An Upskilling Session for Allies.”</p><p>As 2022 progressed, we shifted to a hybrid of in-person and virtual events in order to foster more interaction and strengthen bonds. Our celebration of UK Black History Month included a cross-culture party in our Lisbon office. We collaborated with Latinflare &amp; Wineflare on an International Wine tasting event featuring South African wines, and an African + Caribbean food tasting event called “Taste from Home. We wrapped up the festivities with a Black Woman in Tech panel to discuss bias and how to navigate various obstacles faced by the BIPOC community in tech.</p><p>Virtually or in-person, this community has become a family – we laugh together, cry together, teach each other, and continue to grow together year after year.

Our vision is to address the climate crisis through an intersectional lens and help Cloudflare become a clear leader in sustainable practices among tech companies. Greencloud was initially founded in 2019 but experienced most of its growth in membership, engagement, and activities after the pandemic started. The group became an outlet for current and new employees to connect on shared passions and channel our COVID-fueled anxieties for the world into productive climate-focused action.</p><p>Greencloud’s organizing since 2020 has primarily centered around “two weeks of action.” The first is Impact Week (happening now!), which includes projects driven by Greencloud members to help our customers build a more sustainable Internet using Cloudflare products. The second is Earth Week, scheduled around the global Earth Day celebration in April, which focuses on awareness and education. We’ve leveraged the tools available to Cloudflare employees and our community, like our blog and Cloudflare TV, to share information with a broader audience and on a wider range of topics than would be possible with in-person events. This year, publicly available Earth Week programming included sessions about Cloudflare’s sustainability focus for our <a href="https://cloudflare.tv/event/jvPeb0az">hardware lifecycle</a>, an interview with a sustainability-focused <a href="https://cloudflare.tv/event/GZkb4daL">Project Galileo participant</a>, a Policy team overview of our <a href="https://cloudflare.tv/event/bveNeAak">sustainability reporting practices</a>, and a conversation about <a href="https://cloudflare.tv/event/YgQx4pZd">sustainable transportation</a> with our People team. Covering a wide range of topics throughout our events and content created by our members not only helps everyone learn something new, it also reminds us of the importance of embracing and encouraging diverse perspectives in every community. The diversity of the Greencloud collective is a small demonstration of the reality that climate change is only successfully addressed through holistic action by people with many outlooks and skills working together.</p><p>As we embrace more flexible modes of work, the Greencloud crew is looking forward to maintaining our virtual events as well as introducing more in-person opportunities to engage with each other and our local communities. Building and maintaining deep connections with each other is key to the momentum and sustainability(!) of this work in the long term.”</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image5-6.png" class="kg-image" alt="The latest from Cloudflare's seventeen Employee Resource Groups"></figure><p><strong>Desiflare: South Asian delights</strong><br><em>Arwa Ginwala, Solutions Engineering Manager, San Francisco </em></p><p>“Our goal for Desiflare is to build a sense of community among Cloudflare employees using the rich South Asian culture as a platform to bring people together. The Desiflare initiatives that had the most impact were in-person events after the two long years of pandemic. People were longing for a sense of community and belonging after months of Zoom fatigue. It was a fresh breath of air to see fellow Desis in person, across multiple Cloudflare offices. Folks hired during the pandemic got an opportunity to come visit the newly-renovated office in San Francisco. Desis enjoyed South Asian food at the Austin office for the first time since Desiflare’s inception. Diwali was celebrated in Singapore and Sydney offices, and the community in London played cricket, a sport very popular and well-loved in the South Asian community. Regardless of country of origin, gender, age or cultural beliefs, and in the presence of a competitive atmosphere, everyone shared and rejoiced with memories from their childhoods.</p><p>We realize that Desiflare members have different levels of comfort regarding meeting people in person or traveling for in-person events. But everyone wants to feel a sense of community and connection with people who share the same interests. Keeping this in mind, it was important to organize events where everyone felt included and had a chance to be part of the community based on their preferences. We met virtually for weekly chai time, monthly lunches, and are now organizing virtual jam sessions for many Desis to showcase their talent and enjoy South Asian music regardless of where they are located. The community has been most engaged on the Desiflare chat room. It has provided a platform for discussing common topics that help people feel supported. Desiflare gives a unique opportunity to employees to connect with their culture and roots regardless of their job title and team. It's a way to network cross-functionally, and allows you to bring your whole self to work, which is one of the best things about working at Cloudflare.”</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>The ERGs at Cloudflare have helped us realize the power of community and how critical it is for hybrid work. What I have learned alongside our ERG leaders is that if we as individuals want to feel connected, understood and seen, our ERG communities are essential.

The HBCU Smart Cities Challenge invites all HBCUs across the United States to build technological solutions to solve real-world problems. When I learned that Cloudflare would be supporting <a href="https://www.pathwayoz.com/hbcusmartcities">the HBCU Smart Cities Challenge</a>, I was on board immediately for so many personal reasons.</p><p>In addition to volunteering mentors as part of this partnership, Cloudflare offered HBCU Smart Cities the opportunity to apply for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo/">Project Galileo</a> to protect and accelerate their online presence. Project Galileo provides free cyber security protection to free speech, public interest, and civil society organizations that are vulnerable to cyber attacks. After more than three years working at Cloudflare, I know that we can make the difference in bridging the gap in accessibility to the digital landscape by directly securing the Internet against today’s threats as well as optimizing performance, which plays a bigger role than most would think.</p><h3 id="what-is-an-hbcu">What is an HBCU?</h3><p>A Historically Black College or University is defined as “any historically black college or university that was established prior to 1964, whose principal mission was, and is, the education of black Americans, and that is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association determined by the Secretary of Education.” (Source: <a href="https://hbculifestyle.com/what-is-an-hbcu/">What is an HBCU? HBCU Lifestyle</a>).  I had the honor of graduating from the nation’s first degree-granting HBCU, <a href="https://www.lincoln.edu/">Lincoln University of Pennsylvania</a>.</p><p>One of the main reasons that I decided to attend a HBCU is that the available data suggests that HBCUs close the socioeconomic gap for Black students more than other high-education institutions (Source: <a href="https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/analysis/2021/12/01/hbcu-social-economic-mobility/">HBCUs Close Socioeconomic Gap, Here’s How</a>, 2021). This is exemplified by my own experience — I was a student that came from a low-income background, and became the first generation college graduate in my family. I believe it is due to HBCUs providing a united, supportive, and safe space for people from the African diaspora which equips us to be our best.</p><h3 id="the-hbcu-smart-cities-challenge">The HBCU Smart Cities Challenge</h3><p>There are a wide range of problems the HBCU Smart Cities Challenge invites students to tackle. These problems include water management in Tuskegee, AL; broadband and security access in Raleigh, NC; public health for the City of Columbia, SC; and affordable housing in Winston-Salem, NC—just to name a few. Applying skills with smart technology to real-life problems helps improve upon the existing infrastructure in these cities.</p><p>To solve these problems, the challenge brings together students at HBCUs to build smart city applications. Over several months, developers, entrepreneurs, designers, and engineers will develop tech solutions using Internet of Things technology. In October, Cloudflare presented as part of a town hall in the HBCU Smart Cities series. We encouraged local leaders to think about using historic investments in broadband buildout to also lay the foundation for Smart Cities infrastructure at the same time. We described how, with solid infrastructure in place, the Smart Cities applications that are built on top of that infrastructure- would be fast, reliable, and secure — which is a necessity for infrastructure that residents rely on.</p><p>Here are some quotes from Norma McGowan Jackson, District 1 Councilwoman of City of Tuskegee and HBCU Smart City Fellow Arnold Bhebhe:</p><blockquote>"<em>As the council person for District 1 in the City of Tuskegee, which represents Tuskegee University, as the Council liaison for the HBCU Smart Cities Challenge, as a Tuskegee native, and as a Tuskegee Institute, (now University) alumnae, I am delighted to be a part of this collaboration. Since the days of Dr. Booker T. Washington, the symbiotic relationship between the Institute (now University) and the surrounding community has been acknowledged as critical for both entities and this opportunity to further enhance that relationship is a sure win-win!</em>"<br><strong>- Norma McGowan Jackson</strong>, District 1 Councilwoman of City of Tuskegee</blockquote><blockquote>"<em>The HBCU Smart Cities Challenge has helped me to better understand that even though we live in an unpredictable world, our ability to learn and adapt to change can make us better innovators. I’m super grateful to have the opportunity to reinforce my problem-solving, creativity, and communication skills alongside like-minded HBCU students who are passionate about making a positive impact in our community.</em>"<strong> </strong><br><strong>- Arnold Bhebhe</strong>,<strong> </strong>Junior at Alabama State University majoring in computer science</blockquote><h3 id="how-cloudflare-helps">How Cloudflare helps</h3><p>Attending an HBCU was one of the best decisions I have made in my life, and my motivation was seeing the product of HBCU graduates — noting that the first woman Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, is a HBCU graduate from Howard University.</p><p>The biggest honor for me is having the opportunity to build on the brilliance of these college students in this partnership, because I was in their shoes almost 25 years ago.</p><p>Further, to help protect websites associated with HBCU Smart Cities projects, Cloudflare has invited students in the program to apply for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo/">Project Galileo.</a></p><p>Finally, the HBCU Smart Cities Challenge are continually looking for mentors, sponsors and partnerships, as well as support and resources for the students.

The KeepItOn campaign by Access Now, a group that defends the digital rights of global Internet users, documented at least 182 Internet shutdowns in 34 countries in 2021. Many of these shutdowns occurred during public protests, elections, and wars as an extreme form of censorship in places like <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/afghanistan-taliban-internet">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="https://paradigmhq.org/internet-shutdown-dr-congo/">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/stop-internet-shutdowns-in-ukraine/">Ukraine</a>, <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/internet-shutdowns-india-keepiton-2021/">India, </a>and<a href="https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-internet-shutdowns-in-iran/"> Iran</a>.</p><p>There are a range of ways governments block or slow communications, including throttling, IP blocking, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">DNS</a> interference, mobile data shutoffs, and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-a-firewall/">deep packet inspection</a>, all with similar goals: exerting control over information.</p><p>Although Internet shutdowns are largely public, it is difficult to document and track the ways in which governments implement them. The shutdowns not only impact people’s ability to participate in civil and political life and the economy but also have grave consequences for trust in democratic institutions.</p><p>We have<a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2022-internet-disruption-summary/"> reported </a>on these shutdowns in the past, and for Cloudflare Impact Week, we want to tell you more about how we work with civil society organizations to provide tools to track and document the scope of these disruptions. We want to support their critical work and provide the tools they need so they can demand accountability and condemn the use of shutdowns to silence dissent.</p><h3 id="radar-internet-shutdown-alerts-for-civil-society">Radar Internet shutdown alerts for civil society</h3><p>We<a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-radar/"> launched Radar in 2020</a> to shine light on the Internet’s patterns, insights, threats, and trends based on aggregated data from our network. Once we launched Radar, we found that many civil society organizations and those who work in democracy-building use Radar to track trends in countries to better understand the rise and fall of Internet usage.</p><p>Internally, we had an alert system for potential Internet disruptions that we use as an early warning regarding shifts in network patterns and incidents. When we engaged with these organizations that use Radar to track Internet trends, we learned more about how our internal tool to identify traffic distributions could be useful for organizations that work with human rights defenders on the ground that are impacted by these shutdowns.</p><p>To determine the best way to provide a tool to alert organizations when Cloudflare has seen these disruptions, we spoke with organizations such as Access Now, Internews, The Carter Center, National Democratic Institute, Internet Society, and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems. After our conversations, we launched <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/working-with-those-who-protect-human-rights-around-the-world/">Radar Internet shutdown alerts</a> in 2021 to provide alerts on when Cloudflare has detected significant drops in traffic with the hope that the information is used to document, track, and hold institutions accountable for these human rights violations.</p><p>Since 2021, we have been providing these alerts to civil society partners to track these shutdowns. As we have collected feedback to improve the alerts, we have seen many partners looking for more ways to integrate Radar and the alerts into their existing tracking mechanisms. With this, we announced <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/radar2/">Radar 2.0 with API access</a> for free so academics, data sleuths, civil society, human rights organizations, and other web enthusiasts can analyze, visualize, and investigate Internet usage across the globe, based on data from our global network. In addition, we launched <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center">Cloudflare Radar Outage Center </a>to archive Internet outages and make it easier for civil society organizations, journalists/news media, and impacted parties to track past shutdowns.</p><h3 id="highlighting-the-work-of-our-civil-society-partners-to-track-internet-shutdowns">Highlighting the work of our civil society partners to track Internet shutdowns</h3><p>We believe our job at Cloudflare is to build tools that improve privacy and security for a range of players on the Internet.

It now represents more than 280 organizations from 105 countries across the globe. The goal of STOP Project (Shutdown Tracker Optimization Project) is ultimately to document and report shutdowns accurately, which requires diligent verification. Access Now regularly uses multiple sources to identify and understand the shutdown, the choice and combination of which depends on where and how the shutdown occurred.</p><p>The tracker uses both quantitative and qualitative data to record the number of Internet shutdowns in the world in a given year and to characterize the nature of the shutdowns, including their magnitude, scope, and causes. </p><blockquote><strong>Zach Rosson</strong>, #KeepItOn Data Analyst, Access Now, details, “<em>Sometimes, we confirm an Internet shutdown through means such as technical measurement, while at other times we rely upon contextual information, such as news reports or personal accounts. We also work hard to document how a particular shutdown was ordered and how it impacted society, including why and how it happened.</em>”</blockquote><blockquote>On how Access Now’s #KeepItOn coalition uses Cloudflare Radar, <strong>Rosson</strong> says, <strong>“</strong><em>We use Radar Internet shutdown alerts in both email and tweet form, as a trusted source to help verify a shutdown occurrence. These alerts and their underlying measurements are used as primary sources in our dataset when compiling shutdowns for our annual report, so they are used in an archival sense as well. Cloudflare Radar is sometimes the first place that we hear about a shutdown, which is quite useful in a rapid response context, since we can quickly mobilize to verify the shutdown and have strong evidence when advocating against it.</em><strong>”</strong></blockquote><p>The recorded instances of shutdowns include events reported through local or international news sources that are included in the dataset, from local actors through Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline or the #KeepItOn Coalition email list, or directly from telecommunication and Internet companies.</p><blockquote><strong>Rosson</strong> notes, <strong>“</strong><em>When it comes to Radar 2.0 and API, we plan to use these resources to speed up our response, verification, and publication of shutdown data as compiled from different sources. Thus, the Cloudflare Radar Outage Center (CROC) and related API endpoint will be very useful for us to access timely information on shutdowns, either through visual inspection of the CROC in the short term or through using the API to pull data into a centralized database in the long term.</em><strong>”</strong></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/"><strong>Internet Society: ISOC</strong></a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image2-29.png" class="kg-image" alt="Partnering with civil society to track Internet shutdowns with Radar Alerts and API"></figure><p>On the Internet Society Pulse platform, Susannah Gray, Director, Communications, Internet Society, explains that they strive to curate meaningful information around a government-mandated Internet shutdown by using data from multiple trusted sources, and making it available to everyone, everywhere in an easy-to-understand manner. ISOC does this by monitoring Internet traffic using various tools, including Radar. When they see something that might indicate that an Internet shutdown is in progress, they check if the shutdown meets<a href="https://pulse.internetsociety.org/blog/tracking-internet-shutdowns"> their  criteria</a>. For a shutdown to appear on the Pulse Shutdowns Tracker it needs to meet all the following requirements. It must:</p><ul><li>Be artificially induced, as evident from reputable sources, including government statements and orders.</li><li>Remove Internet access.</li><li>Affect access to a group of people.</li></ul><p>Once ISOC is certain that a shutdown is the result of government action, and isn’t the result of<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/major-bgp-leak-disrupts-thousands-of-networks-globally/"> technical errors</a>,<a href="https://www.ripe.net/publications/news/industry-developments/youtube-hijacking-a-ripe-ncc-ris-case-study"> routing misconfigurations</a>, or<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ships-anchor-cuts-internet-cables-to-jersey-jt-2016-11"> infrastructure failures</a>, they prepare an incident page, collate related measurements from their trusted data partners, and then publish the information on the <a href="https://pulse.internetsociety.org/shutdowns">Pulse shutdowns tracker</a>.</p><blockquote>ISOC uses many resources to track shutdowns. <strong>Gray</strong> explains, <strong>“</strong><em>Radar Internet shutdown alerts are incredibly useful for bringing incidents to our attention as they are happening. The easy access to the data provided helps us assess the nature of an outage. If an outage is established as a government-mandated shutdown, we often use <a href="https://pulse.internetsociety.org/shutdowns/short-internet-disruption-in-cuba">screenshots of Radar charts</a> on the Pulse shutdowns tracker incident page to help illustrate how traffic stopped flowing in and out of a country during the shutdown. We provide a link back to the Radar platform so that people interested in getting more in-depth data can find out more.</em><strong>”</strong></blockquote><p>ISOC’s aim has never been to be the first to report a government-mandated shutdown: instead, their mission is to report accurate and meaningful information about the shutdown and explore its impact on the economy and society.</p><blockquote><strong>Gray</strong> adds, <strong>“</strong><em>For Radar 2.0 and the API, we plan to use it as part of the data aggregation tool we are developing.

The Internet doesn’t go through customs, it doesn’t need a visa, and it doesn’t speak any one language. To reach the world’s greatest information innovation, a user – no matter what country they’re in – only needs a device with a connection. The Internet will take care of the rest. At Cloudflare, part of our role is to make sure every person on the planet with an Internet connection has a good experience, whether they’re in a next-generation market or a current-gen market. In this blog we’re going to talk about how we define next-generation markets, how we help people in these markets get faster access to the websites and applications they use on a daily basis, and how we make it easy for developers to deploy services geographically close to users in next-generation markets.</p><h2 id="what-are-next-generation-markets">What are next-generation markets?</h2><p>Next-generation markets are the future of the Internet. Not only are there billions of people who will use the Internet more, as affordable access increases, but the trends in application development already point towards the mobile-first, sometimes mobile-only, way of providing content and services. The Internet may look different (more desktop-centric) in the so-called Global North or countries the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/FMEconGroup.xlsx">IMF defines as Advanced Economies</a>, but those differences will shrink as application developers build products for all markets, not just current-generation markets. We call these markets next-generation markets as opposed to using the IMF or World Bank definitions because we want to classify markets by how users interact with the Internet as opposed to how their governments interact with the global economy. Compared to North America and Europe, where users access the Internet through a combination of desktop computers and mobile devices, users in next-generation markets access the Internet via <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/where-mobile-traffic-more-and-less-popular/">mobile devices</a> 50% of the time or more, sometimes even as high as 80%. Some examples of these markets are China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, and countries in Africa and the Middle East.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image4.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare helps next-generation markets"></figure><p>Most of this traffic is also using HTTP/S, which is the industry standard for secure, performant, reliable communication on the Internet. HTTP/S is used broadly across the Internet about 88% of the time. Countries and regions that have a higher percentage of mobile users will also have a higher percentage of traffic over HTTP/S, as shown in the table below. For example, countries in Africa and APJC use HTTP/S more than any other protocol, beating all other regions. By contrast, in North America, more traffic uses older protocols like SMTP, FTP, or RTMP. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table width="100%">

</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The prevalence of mobile Internet connections is also represented by the types of applications developers are building in these regions: local models of popular applications designed specifically for local users in mind. For example, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/carousell/">ecommerce companies like Carousell</a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/how-bookmyshow-uses-cloudflare-to-mitigate-massive-ddos-attacks/">ticketing companies like BookMyShow</a> rely on mobile and app-based users for most of their business that is unique to the region they’re based in. Getting more broad, apps like Instagram and TikTok famously do not have web or desktop-based applications, and they encourage users to be mobile-only. These markets are next-generation because most of their users are using mobile devices and applications like Carousell, which are designed for a mobile, performant Internet.</p><p>In these markets there are two groups who have similar concerns but are different enough that we need to address them separately: users, and the application developers who build the apps for users. They both want one thing: to be fast. But being fast manifests itself in slightly different ways for users versus application developers. Let’s talk about each group and how Cloudflare helps solve their problems.</p><h2 id="next-generation-users">Next-generation users</h2><p>Users in these markets care about observed experience: they want real-time interaction with their applications. This is no different from what users in other markets expect from the Internet, but achieving this is much harder over mobile networks, which tend to have higher latency, loss, and lower bandwidth.</p><p>Another challenge in next-generation markets is, roughly speaking, how geographically dispersed Internet connectivity is. Imagine you are sending a message to someone on the other side of a park, but you have to play telephone: the only way you can send the message is by telling someone next to you, and they tell it to the person next to them, and so on and so forth until the message reaches the other side of the park. That may look a little something like this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image10.png" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare helps next-generation markets"></figure><p>If you’ve ever played Telephone, you know that this is optimistic: even when someone is right next to you, it’s unlikely that they’ll be able to get all the message you’re trying to send. But let’s say that the optimistic case is real: in this above scenario, you’re able to transmit the message between people end-to-end across the park. Now let’s say you take half of those people away, meaning that everyone who’s sending the message needs to shout twice as far. That’s when things can start to get a little more garbled:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image1-38.png" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare helps next-generation markets"></figure><p>In this case, the receiver of the message didn’t hear the message properly the first time, and asked for the sender to yell it again. This process, called retransmission, reduces the amount of data that can be sent at once over the Internet. Retransmission rates depend on the cellular density of wireless networks, the light signal of fiber optic cables, and on the broader Internet, the number of hops between the end user and the website or receiver of the connection.</p><p>Retransmission rates are impacted by something called packet loss, when some packets don’t make it to the receiver end due to things like poor signal transmission, or errors on devices in the path between sender and receiver. When packet loss occurs, protocols on the Internet like the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) </a>will reduce the amount of data that can be transmitted over the connection. The amount of data that can be sent at one time is called the congestion window, and the protocol will shrink the congestion window to help preserve the connection until TCP is sure that the connection won’t drop packets again. This process of shrinking the congestion window is called backoff, and the congestion window will shrink exponentially when packet loss is first detected, and then will increase linearly over time. This means that connections and networks with high retransmission rates can seriously impact how users interact with websites and applications on the Internet.</p><h2 id="the-edge-partner-program-gets-us-closer-to-users">The Edge Partner Program gets us closer to users</h2><p>Since most users in next-generation markets are mobile, getting closer to users is paramount for a fast experience. Mobile devices tend to be slower because interference with the radio waves can often add additional instability to the Internet connection, which can lead to poor performance. In next generation markets, there could be added challenges from issues like power consumption: if a power grid can’t support large radio towers, smaller ones with a smaller range are required, which can further add instability, increase retransmission, and add latency.</p><p>However, in addition to challenges in the local network, there’s another challenge with interconnecting these networks to the rest of the Internet. Networks in next-generation markets may not be able to reach as many peering points as larger networks and may need to optimize their peering by going into Internet Exchanges that have denser connectivity with more networks, even if they’re farther away. For example, places like Frankfurt, London, and Singapore are especially useful for interconnecting a large amount of networks in a few Internet Exchanges in regions like the Middle East, Africa, and Asia respectively.</p><p>The downside for end-users is that in order to connect to the Internet and the sites they care about, networks in these markets have to go a long way to get to the rest of the Internet. For content that is cacheable, meaning it doesn’t change often, sending requests for data (and the response) across oceans and continents is a poor use of Internet capacity. Worse, it leads to problems like congestion, retransmission, and packet loss, which in turn cause poor performance.</p><p>One area where we see latency directly impact Internet performance is in TLS, or Transport Layer Security. TLS ensures that an end-user interaction with an application is private. When TLS is established, it performs a three-way handshake that requires the end user to initiate a connection, the server to respond, and the end-user to acknowledge the response before any data can be sent. The farther away an end-user is from a website or CDN that performs this handshake, the longer it will take, and the worse performance will be:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image11.png" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare helps next-generation markets"></figure><p>Getting close to users often improves not just end-user performance, but the basic stability of an Internet experience on the network. Cloudflare helps solve this through our Edge Partner Program (EPP), which allows ISPs to integrate their networks physically and locally with Cloudflare, bringing us as close as possible to their users. When we embed a Cloudflare node in an ISP, we shorten the physical distance between end-users and Cloudflare, and by extension, the amount of time end-users’ data requests spend on the backbone of the Internet. Over the past four years, 80% of our 107 new cities have been in next-generation markets to help improve our cached and dynamic performance.</p><p>Another additional benefit of having the content and services delivered close to end users: we can use our network intelligence to route traffic out of your last mile network and where it needs to go, helping improve the user experience out to the rest of the Internet as well. On average, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-routing/">Argo Smart Routing</a> helps improve dynamic and uncached content performance by over 30%, which is especially valuable if the content users need to fetch is far away from their devices.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image13-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare helps next-generation markets"></figure><p>Now that we’ve talked about why the Edge Partner Program is important and how it can theoretically help users, let’s talk about one set of those deployments in Saudi Arabia to show you how it actually helps users.</p><h3 id="edge-partner-program-in-saudi-arabia">Edge Partner Program in Saudi Arabia</h3><p>A great example of a place that can benefit greatly from the Edge Partner Program is Saudi Arabia, a country whose closest peering to Cloudflare was previously in Frankfurt. As we mentioned above, for many countries in the Middle East, Frankfurt is where these networks choose to peer with other networks despite Frankfurt being over 5,300 km away from Riyadh.</p><p>But by landing Cloudflare network hardware in the mobile network Mobily, we were able to improve median RTT by over 50% for their users. Before our deployment, end users on Mobily had a median RTT of 131ms via Frankfurt. Once we added three sites in Dammam, Riyadh, and Jeddah on this network, Mobily users saw a huge decrease in latency, to the point where the <em>median</em> RTT (131ms) before these deployments now became around the 85th percentile afterwards. Before, one out of every two requests took longer than 131ms, while afterward almost every request (85% of them) took less than that time. So users in Saudi Arabia get a faster path to the sites and services they care about through their ISP and Cloudflare. Everyone wins.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image9-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare helps next-generation markets"></figure><p>Staying local also helps reduce retransmission and the amount of data that has to be sent over these networks. Consider two data centers: one of our largest data centers in Los Angeles, California, and one of those new data centers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Los Angeles takes traffic from all over the world: from places like China, Indonesia, Australia, as well as locally in the Los Angeles area. Take a look at the average retransmission rate for connections coming into Los Angeles from all over the world:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image6-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare helps next-generation markets"></figure><p>The average rate is quite high for Los Angeles, mostly due to users from all places like China, Indonesia, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan coming to Los Angeles for their websites. But if you take a look at Jeddah, you’ll see a different story:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image5-5.png" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare helps next-generation markets"></figure><p>Users in Jeddah have a much lower, more constant retransmission rate because users on Mobily are terminating their connections closer to their devices. By being embedded in Mobily’s network, we decrease the number of hops that are needed and also make the hops that travel over less reliable paths shorter. Initial requests are more likely to succeed the first time and don’t need multiple tries to succeed.</p><h2 id="warp-in-next-generation-markets">WARP in next-generation markets</h2><p>Cloudflare WARP is a great privacy-preserving tool for users in any market to help ensure a privacy-first, performant path to the Internet. While users around the world can use WARP, users in next-generation markets are ahead of the curve when it comes to WARP adoption. Here are the total year-to-date WARP downloads from the Apple App Store:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image7-5.png" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare helps next-generation markets"></figure><p>We’ve recently made changes to <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-experience-larger-network/">add WARP support to more Edge Partner locations</a>, which provides a faster, more private experience to these locations. Now even more WARP users can see better performance in more locations.</p><p>WARP pairs well with the Cloudflare network to ensure a fast, private Internet experience. In a growing number of networks in next-generation markets, WARP users will connect to Cloudflare in the same location as their ISP before going out to the rest of the Internet. If the websites they are trying to connect to are protected by Cloudflare, then they get a fast path to the websites they care about through Cloudflare. If not, then the users can still get sent out through Cloudflare to the websites they need while preserving their privacy throughout the connection.</p><h2 id="next-generation-developers">Next-generation developers</h2><p>Let’s say you’re an app developer in Muscat, Oman, trying to make a new shopping app specific to your market. To compete with other existing apps, you not only need a differentiator, but you need an in-app performance experience that is on par with your competitors while also being able to deliver your service and make money. Global shopping apps offer a real-time browsing experience that your regional app also needs to meet, or beat. If outside competitors have a faster shopping app than you, it doesn’t really matter if your app is “the Amazon of Oman” if actual Amazon is faster in the country.</p><p>But in next-generation markets, performance is often a differentiator between their applications and incumbent applications -- often because incumbent apps tend to not perform as well in these markets. This is often because incumbent applications will host using cloud providers that may not offer services in-region. For example, users in the APJC region may often see their traffic get sent to Hong Kong, Singapore, or even Los Angeles because that is the closest cloud datacenter to them. So when you’re making “the Amazon of Indonesia” and you need your app to be faster than Amazon’s in Indonesia, having your application be as local as possible to your users will help realize your app’s appeal: a specialized, high-performance experience for Indonesian users.</p><p>It’s worth noting that many cloud locations do offer local options for developers: if you’re in Oman, there is a local cloud datacenter to you where you can host your service. But most startup and smaller businesses built in next-generation markets will opt to host their app in larger, farther away locations to optimize for cost.</p><p>For example, localizing in the Middle East can be very costly compared to farther away options. Developers in the Middle East may be able to save 30% or more on their monthly data transfer costs simply by moving to Frankfurt; a region that is farther away from their users but is cheaper for them to serve out of. Application developers are constantly trying to balance cost with user experience, and may make some tradeoffs for user experience that allow them to optimize costs in the short term. So even though Cloudflare-protected developers are taking advantage of the local peering from the Edge Partner Program, developers in Oman may end up sending their users to Frankfurt anyways because that’s where they chose to host their services to save costs. In many cases, this is a tradeoff developers in these markets have to make: making your service slightly less performant to enable it to run more cheaply.</p><h2 id="cloudflare-workers-in-country">Cloudflare Workers in country</h2><p>Luckily for these developers, Cloudflare’s developer platform allows application developers to build a distributed application that runs right where their users are, so they don’t have to choose between performance and cost savings. Taking the Saudi Arabia case, users on Mobily now get their traffic terminated locally in Jeddah. This is okay from an end-to-end perspective because it means that Cloudflare gets to find the fastest path through the Internet using technologies like Argo Smart Routing which will help them save 30% on their Time to First Byte if their users have to go out of the country. But what if users didn’t ever have to leave Jeddah at all?</p><p>By moving applications to Cloudflare, you can push more and more of your applications to these data centers in next-generation markets, ensuring that users get a better experience in-country. For example, let’s consider the <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/network-performance-update-developer-week/">same comparison data</a> we used to evaluate ourselves versus Lambda@Edge during our Developer Week performance tests. The purpose of this comparison is to show how far your users have to travel if you’re hosting application compute on Cloudflare versus on AWS. When you compare us versus Lambda@Edge, we have a significant advantage for P95 TCP Connection time in next-generation markets.  This chart and table below show that in Africa and Asia Cloudflare Workers is about 3x as fast as Lambda@Edge from AWS:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image2-33.png" class="kg-image" alt="How Cloudflare helps next-generation markets"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table width="100%">

The Lambda@Edge scenarios are bad enough on their own, but  consider that not everything can be done in Lambda@Edge and may need to reach AWS instances that may sit even farther away than the AWS edge. Cloudflare’s supercloud looks especially attractive because we allow you to build everything you need in an application entirely local to end-users.

Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are essential to network communication. Many networks make use of IPv4 addresses that are reserved for private use, and devices in the network are able to connect to the Internet with the use of network address translation (NAT), a process that maps one or more local private addresses to one or more global IP addresses and vice versa before transferring the information.</p><p>Your home Internet router most likely does this for you. You will likely find that, when at home, your computer has an IP address like 192.168.1.42. That’s an example of a private use address that is fine to use at home, but can’t be used on the public Internet. Your home router translates it, through NAT, to an address your ISP assigned to your home and that can be used on the Internet.</p><p>Here are the reserved “private use” addresses designated in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1918">RFC 1918</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table width="100%">

These are called “reverse lookups'' because they ask the DNS if there is a name associated with an address.</p><h3 id="reverse-dns-lookup">Reverse DNS lookup</h3><p>A reverse DNS lookup is an opposite process of the more commonly used DNS lookup (which is used every day to translate a name like <a href="http://www.cloudflare.com">www.cloudflare.com</a> to its corresponding IP address). It is a query to look up the domain name associated with a given IP address, in particular those addresses associated with routers and switches. For example, network administrators and researchers use reverse lookups to help understand paths being taken by data packets in the network, and it’s much easier to understand meaningful names than a meaningless number.</p><p>A reverse lookup is accomplished by querying DNS servers for a pointer record (<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ptr-record/">PTR</a>). PTR records store IP addresses with their segments reversed, and by appending ".in-addr.arpa" to the end. For example, the IP address 192.0.2.1 will have the PTR record stored as 1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. In IPv6, PTR records are stored within the ".ip6.arpa" domain instead of ".in-addr.arpa.".

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="the-problem-that-private-use-addresses-cause-for-dns">The problem that private use addresses cause for DNS</h3><p>The private use addresses concerned have only local significance and cannot be resolved by the public DNS. In other words, there is no way for the public DNS to provide a useful answer to a question that has no global meaning. It is therefore a good practice for network administrators to ensure that queries for private use addresses are answered locally. However, it is not uncommon for such queries to follow the normal delegation path in the public DNS instead of being answered within the network. That creates unnecessary load.</p><p>By definition of being private use, they have no ownership in the public sphere, so there are no authoritative DNS servers to answer the queries. At the very beginning, root servers respond to all these types of queries since they serve the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone.</p><p>Over time, due to the wide deployment of private use addresses and the continuing growth of the Internet, traffic on the IN-ADDR.ARPA DNS infrastructure grew and the load due to these junk queries started to cause some concern. Therefore, the idea of offloading IN-ADDR.ARPA queries related to private use addresses was proposed. Following that, the use of anycast for distributing authoritative DNS service for that idea was subsequently proposed at a private meeting of root server operators. And eventually the AS112 service was launched to provide an alternative target for the junk.</p><h3 id="the-as112-project-is-born">The AS112 project is born</h3><p>To deal with this problem, the Internet community set up special DNS servers called “blackhole servers” as the authoritative name servers that respond to the reverse lookup of the private use address blocks 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 and the link-local address block 169.254.0.0/16 (which also has only local significance). Since the relevant zones are directly delegated to the blackhole servers, this approach has come to be known as Direct Delegation.</p><p>The first two blackhole servers set up by the project are: blackhole-1.iana.org and blackhole-2.iana.org.</p><p>Any server, including DNS name server, needs an IP address to be reachable. The IP address must also be associated with an Autonomous System Number (ASN) so that networks can recognize other networks and route data packets to the IP address destination. To solve this problem, a new authoritative DNS service would be created but, to make it work, the community would have to designate IP addresses for the servers and, to facilitate their availability, an AS number that network operators could use to reach (or provide) the new service.</p><p>The selected AS number (provided by American Registry for Internet Numbers) and namesake of the project, was 112. It was started by a small subset of root server operators, later grown to a group of volunteer name server operators that include many other organizations. They run anycasted instances of the blackhole servers that, together, form a distributed sink for the reverse DNS lookups for private network and link-local addresses sent to the public Internet.</p><p>A reverse DNS lookup for a private use address would see responses like in the example below, where the name server blackhole-1.iana.org is authoritative for it and says the name does not exist, represented in DNS responses by <strong>NXDOMAIN</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>$ dig @blackhole-1.iana.org -x 192.168.1.1 +nord

Introduced by <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6672">RFC 6672</a>, a DNAME record or Delegation Name Record creates an alias for an entire subtree of the domain name tree. In contrast, the CNAME record creates an alias for a single name and not its subdomains. For a received DNS query, the DNAME record instructs the name server to substitute all those appearing in the left hand (owner name) with the right hand (alias name). The substituted query name, like the CNAME, may live within the zone or may live outside the zone.</p><p>Like the CNAME record, the DNS lookup will continue by retrying the lookup with the substituted name.

Being a part of this project aligns with Cloudflare’s mission to help build a better Internet.</p><p>Cloudflare is one of the fastest global anycast networks on the planet, and operates one of the largest, highly performant and reliable DNS services. We run authoritative DNS for millions of Internet properties globally. We also operate the privacy- and performance-focused public DNS resolver 1.1.1.1 service. Given our network presence and scale of operations, we believe we can make a meaningful contribution to the AS112 project.</p><h2 id="how-we-built-it">How we built it</h2><p>We’ve publicly talked about the Cloudflare in-house built authoritative DNS server software, rrDNS, several times in the past, but haven’t talked much about the software we built to power the Cloudflare public resolver - 1.1.1.1. This is an opportunity to shed some light on the technology we used to build 1.1.1.1, because this AS112 service is built on top of the same platform.</p><h3 id="a-platform-for-dns-workloads">A platform for DNS workloads</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image1-32.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare is joining the AS112 project to help the Internet deal with misdirected DNS queries"></figure><p>We’ve created a platform to run DNS workloads. Today, it powers 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.1 for Families, Oblivious DNS over HTTPS (ODoH), Cloudflare WARP and Cloudflare Gateway.</p><p>The core part of the platform is a non-traditional DNS server, which has a built-in DNS recursive resolver and a forwarder to forward queries to other servers. It consists of four key modules:</p><ol><li>A highly efficient listener module that accepts connections for incoming requests.</li><li>A query router module that decides how a query should be resolved.</li><li>A conductor module that figures out the best way of exchanging DNS messages with upstream servers.</li><li>A sandbox environment to host guest applications.</li></ol><p>The DNS server itself doesn’t include any business logic, instead the guest applications run in the sandbox environment can implement concrete business logic such as request filtering, query processing, logging, attack mitigation, cache purging, etc.</p><p>The server is written in Rust and the sandbox environment is built on top of a WebAssembly runtime. The combination of Rust and WebAssembly allow us to implement high efficient connection handling, request filtering and query dispatching modules, while having the flexibility of implementing custom business logic in a safe and efficient manner.</p><p>The host exposes a set of APIs, called hostcalls, for the guest applications to accomplish a variety of tasks. You can think of them like syscalls on Linux. Here are few examples functions provided by the hostcalls:</p><ul><li>Obtain the current UNIX timestamp</li><li>Lookup geolocation data of IP addresses</li><li>Spawn async tasks</li><li>Create local sockets</li><li>Forward DNS queries to designated servers</li><li>Register callback functions of the sandbox hooks</li><li>Read current request information, and write responses</li><li>Emit application logs, metric data points and tracing spans/events</li></ul><p>The DNS request lifecycle is broken down into phases. A request phase is a point in processing at which sandboxed apps can be called to change the course of request resolution. And each guest application can register callbacks for each phase.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="http://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2022/12/image3-20.png" class="kg-image" alt="Cloudflare is joining the AS112 project to help the Internet deal with misdirected DNS queries"></figure><h3 id="as112-guest-application">AS112 guest application</h3><p>The AS112 service is built as a guest application written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly.

Incoming queries are answered locally by looking up entries in the zone tree.</p><p>A router setting in the app manifest is added to tell the host what kind of DNS queries should be processed by the guest application, and a fallback_action setting is added to declare the expected fallback behavior.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code># Declare what kind of queries the app handles.

Do we have to restart the DNS server every time we add a new guest application? Of course there is no need.

For example, a rule like following:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><code>phase = post-cache and qtype in { PTR } and colo in { test1 test2 } and qname-suffix in { 10.in-addr.arpa 16.172.in-addr.arpa 17.172.in-addr.arpa 18.172.in-addr.arpa 19.172.in-addr.arpa 20.172.in-addr.arpa 21.172.in-addr.arpa 22.172.in-addr.arpa 23.172.in-addr.arpa 24.172.in-addr.arpa 25.172.in-addr.arpa 26.172.in-addr.arpa 27.172.in-addr.arpa 28.172.in-addr.arpa 29.172.in-addr.arpa 30.172.in-addr.arpa 31.172.in-addr.arpa 168.192.in-addr.arpa 254.169.in-addr.arpa } forward 192.175.48.6:53</code></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The rule instructs that in data center test1 and test2, when the DNS query type is PTR, and the query name ends with those in the list, forward the query to server 192.175.48.6 (one of the AS112 service IPs) on port 53.</p><p>Because we’ve provisioned the AS112 IP prefixes in the same node, the new AS112 service will receive the queries and respond to the resolver.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that the above-mentioned dynamic rule that intercepts a query at the post-cache phase, and changes how the query gets processed, is executed by a guest application too, which is named override.
